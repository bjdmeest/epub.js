To see the dissolute wench hang on the blear-eyed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span>, windows<br/>are eyes.<br/></div>
<p>Thereupon the young man laughed and caressed the wench. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hag" property="schema:name">crone</span> was la Falourdel; the girl was a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" property="schema:name">courtesan</span>; the young man was his brother Jehan.</p>
<p>He continued to gaze. That spectacle was as good as any other.</p>
<p>He saw Jehan go to a window at the end of the room, open it, cast a glance on the quay, where in the distance blazed a thousand lighted casements, and he heard him say as he closed the sash,—</p>
<p>"'Pon my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>! How dark it is; the people are lighting their candles, and the good <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> his stars."</p>
<p>Then Jehan came back to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hag" property="schema:name">hag</span>, smashed a bottle standing on the table, exclaiming,—</p>
<p>"Already empty, <i>cor-boeuf</i>! and I have no more money! Isabeau, my dear, I shall not be satisfied with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span> until he has changed your two white nipples into two black bottles, where I may suck <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burgundy_wine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Beaune</span> day and night."</p>
<p>This fine pleasantry made the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" property="schema:name">courtesan</span> laugh, and Jehan left the room.</p>
<p>Dom Claude had barely time to fling himself on the ground in order that he might not be met, stared in the face and recognized by his brother. Luckily, the street was dark, and the scholar was tipsy. Nevertheless, he caught sight of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> prone upon the earth in the mud.</p>
<p>"Oh! oh!" said he; "here's a fellow who has been leading a jolly life, to-day."</p>
<p>He stirred up Dom Claude with his foot, and the latter held his breath.</p>
<p>"Dead drunk," resumed Jehan. "Come, he's full. A regular <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leech" property="schema:name">leech</span> detached from a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hogshead" property="schema:name">hogshead</span>. He's bald," he added, bending down, "'tis an old man! <i>Fortunate senex</i>!"</p>
<p>Then Dom Claude heard him retreat, saying,—</p>
<p>"'Tis all the same, reason is a fine thing, and my brother the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> is very happy in that he is wise and has money."</p>
<p>Then the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> rose to his feet, and ran without halting, towards Notre-Dame, whose enormous towers he beheld rising above the houses through the gloom.</p>
<p>At the instant when he arrived, panting, on the Place du Parvis, he shrank back and dared not raise his eyes to the fatal edifice.</p>
<p>"Oh!" he said, in a low voice, "is it really true that such a thing took place here, to-day, this very morning?"</p>
<p>Still, he ventured to glance at the church. The front was sombre; the sky behind was glittering with stars. The crescent of the moon, in her flight upward from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horizon" property="schema:name">horizon</span>, had paused at the moment, on the summit of the light hand tower, and seemed to have perched itself, like a luminous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">bird</span>, on the edge of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span>, cut out in black <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trefoil" property="schema:name">trefoils</span>.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span> door was shut; but the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> always carried with him the key of the tower in which his laboratory was situated. He made use of it to enter the church.</p>
<p>In the church he found the gloom and silence of a cavern. By the deep shadows which fell in broad sheets from all directions, he recognized the fact that the hangings for the ceremony of the morning had not yet been removed. The great silver cross shone from the depths of the gloom, powdered with some sparkling points, like the milky way of that sepulchral night. The long windows of the choir showed the upper extremities of their arches above the black draperies, and their painted panes, traversed by a ray of moonlight had no longer any hues but the doubtful colors of night, a sort of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violet_(color)" property="schema:name">violet</span>, white and blue, whose tint is found only on the faces of the dead. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, on perceiving these <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wide_area_network" property="schema:name">wan</span> spots all around the choir, thought he beheld the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mitre" property="schema:name">mitres</span> of damned bishops. He shut his eyes, and when he opened them again, he thought they were a circle of pale visages gazing at him.</p>
<p>He started to flee across the church. Then it seemed to him that the church also was shaking, moving, becoming endued with animation, that it was alive; that each of the great columns was turning into an enormous paw, which was beating the earth with its big stone <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spatula" property="schema:name">spatula</span>, and that the gigantic cathedral was no longer anything but a sort of prodigious <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elephant" property="schema:name">elephant</span>, which was breathing and marching with its pillars for feet, its two towers for trunks and the immense black cloth for its housings.</p>
<p>This <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fever" property="schema:name">fever</span> or madness had reached such a degree of intensity that the external world was no longer anything more for the unhappy man than a sort of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apocalypse" property="schema:name">Apocalypse</span>,—visible, palpable, terrible.</p>
<p>For one moment, he was relieved. As he plunged into the side <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aisle" property="schema:name">aisles</span>, he perceived a reddish light behind a cluster of pillars. He ran towards it as to a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Star" property="schema:name">star</span>. It was the poor lamp which lighted the public <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breviary" property="schema:name">breviary</span> of Notre-Dame night and day, beneath its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> grating. He flung himself eagerly upon the holy book in the hope of finding some consolation, or some encouragement there. The hook lay open at this passage of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book_of_Job" property="schema:name">Job</span>, over which his staring eye glanced,—</p>
<p>"And a spirit passed before my face, and I heard a small voice, and the hair of my flesh stood up."</p>
<p>On reading these gloomy words, he felt that which a blind man feels when he feels himself pricked by the staff which he has picked up. His knees gave way beneath him, and he sank upon the pavement, thinking of her who had died that day. He felt so many monstrous vapors pass and discharge themselves in his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_brain" property="schema:name">brain</span>, that it seemed to him that his head had become one of the chimneys of hell.</p>
<p>It would appear that he remained a long time in this attitude, no longer thinking, overwhelmed and passive beneath the hand of the demon. At length some strength returned to him; it occurred to him to take refuge in his tower beside his faithful <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. He rose; and, as he was afraid, he took the lamp from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breviary" property="schema:name">breviary</span> to light his way. It was a sacrilege; but he had got beyond heeding such a trifle now.</p>
<p>He slowly climbed the stairs of the towers, filled with a secret fright which must have been communicated to the rare passers-by in the Place du Parvis by the mysterious light of his lamp, mounting so late from loophole to loophole of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell tower</span>.</p>
<p>All at once, he felt a freshness on his face, and found himself at the door of the highest gallery. The air was cold; the sky was filled with hurrying clouds, whose large, white flakes drifted one upon another like the breaking up of river ice after the winter. The crescent of the moon, stranded in the midst of the clouds, seemed a celestial vessel caught in the ice-cakes of the air.</p>
<p>He lowered his gaze, and contemplated for a moment, through the railing of slender columns which unites the two towers, far away, through a gauze of mists and smoke, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span> throng of the roofs of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, pointed, innumerable, crowded and small like the waves of a tranquil sea on a sum-mer night.</p>
<p>The moon cast a feeble ray, which imparted to earth and heaven an ashy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hue" property="schema:name">hue</span>.</p>
<p>At that moment the clock raised its shrill, cracked voice. Midnight rang out. The priest thought of midday; twelve o'clock had come back again.</p>
<p>"Oh!" he said in a very low tone, "she must be cold now."</p>
<p>All at once, a gust of wind extinguished his lamp, and almost at the same instant, he beheld a shade, a whiteness, a form, a woman, appear from the opposite angle of the tower. He started. Beside this woman was a little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, which mingled its bleat with the last bleat of the clock.</p>
<p>He had strength enough to look. It was she.</p>
<p>She was pale, she was gloomy. Her hair fell over her shoulders as in the morning; but there was no longer a rope on her neck, her hands were no longer bound; she was free, she was dead.</p>
<p>She was dressed in white and had a white veil on her head.</p>
<p>She came towards him, slowly, with her gaze fixed on the sky. The supernatural <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> followed her. He felt as though made of stone and too heavy to flee. At every step which she took in advance, he took one backwards, and that was all. In this way he retreated once more beneath the gloomy arch of the stairway. He was chilled by the thought that she might enter there also; had she done so, he would have died of terror.</p>
<p>She did arrive, in fact, in front of the door to the stairway, and paused there for several minutes, stared intently into the darkness, but without appearing to see the priest, and passed on. She seemed taller to him than when she had been alive; he saw the moon through her white robe; he heard her breath.</p>
<p>When she had passed on, he began to descend the staircase again, with the slowness which he had observed in the spectre, believing himself to be a spectre too, haggard, with hair on end, his extinguished lamp still in his hand; and as he descended the spiral steps, he distinctly heard in his ear a voice laughing and repeating,—</p>
<p>"A spirit passed before my face, and I heard a small voice, and the hair of my flesh stood up."</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00059">CHAPTER II. HUNCHBACKED, ONE EYED, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/LAME" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">LAME</span>.</h2>
<p>Every city during the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span>, and every city in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span> down to the time of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XII_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XII</span>. had its places of asylum. These sanctuaries, in the midst of the deluge of penal and barbarous jurisdictions which inundated the city, were a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Species" property="schema:name">species</span> of islands which rose above the level of human justice. Every criminal who landed there was safe. There were in every suburb almost as many places of asylum as <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallows" property="schema:name">gallows</span>. It was the abuse of impunity by the side of the abuse of punishment; two bad things which strove to correct each other. The palaces of the king, the hotels of the princes, and especially churches, possessed the right of asylum. Sometimes a whole city which stood in need of being repeopled was temporarily created a place of refuge. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. made all <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> a refuge in 1467.</p>
<p>His foot once within the asylum, the criminal was sacred; but he must beware of leaving it; one step outside the sanctuary, and he fell back into the flood. The wheel, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strappado" property="schema:name">strappado</span>, kept good guard around the place of refuge, and lay in watch incessantly for their prey, like <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shark" property="schema:name">sharks</span> around a vessel. Hence, condemned men were to be seen whose hair had grown white in a cloister, on the steps of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace_of_Versailles" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">palace</span>, in the enclosure of an abbey, beneath the porch of a church; in this manner the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sanctuary" property="schema:name">asylum</span> was a prison as much as any other. It sometimes happened that a solemn decree of parliament violated the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sanctuary" property="schema:name">asylum</span> and restored the condemned man to the executioner; but this was of rare occurrence. Parliaments were afraid of the bishops, and when there was friction between these two robes, the gown had but a poor chance against the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cassock" property="schema:name">cassock</span>. Sometimes, however, as in the affair of the assassins of Petit-Jean, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Executioner" property="schema:name">headsman</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, and in that of Emery <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Rousseau</span>, the murderer of Jean Valleret, justice overleaped the church and passed on to the execution of its sentences; but unless by virtue of a decree of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parliament_of_England" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">Parliament</span>, woe to him who violated a place of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sanctuary" property="schema:name">asylum</span> with armed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span>! The reader knows the manner of death of Robert de Clermont, Marshal of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>, and of Jean de Châlons, Marshal of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Champagne_(historical_province)" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Champagne</span>; and yet the question was only of a certain Perrin Marc, the clerk of a money-changer, a miserable assassin; but the two marshals had broken the doors of St. Méry. Therein lay the enormity.</p>
<p>Such respect was cherished for places of refuge that, according to tradition, animals even felt it at times. Aymoire relates that a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deer" property="schema:name">stag</span>, being chased by Dagobert, having taken refuge near the tomb of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Denis" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Denis</span>, the pack of hounds stopped short and barked.</p>
<p>Churches generally had a small apartment prepared for the reception of supplicants. In 1407, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolas_Flamel" property="schema:name">Nicolas Flamel</span> caused to be built on the vaults of Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie, a chamber which cost him four <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_livre" property="schema:name">livres</span> six sous, sixteen farthings, parisis.</p>
<p>At Notre-Dame it was a tiny cell situated on the roof of the side <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aisle" property="schema:name">aisle</span>, beneath the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flying_buttress" property="schema:name">flying buttresses</span>, precisely at the spot where the wife of the present janitor of the towers has made for herself a garden, which is to the hanging gardens of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon" property="schema:name">Babylon</span> what a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lettuce" property="schema:name">lettuce</span> is to a palm-tree, what a porter's wife is to a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semiramis" property="schema:name">Semiramis</span>.</p>
<p>It was here that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had deposited <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span>, after his wild and triumphant course. As long as that course lasted, the young girl had been unable to recover her senses, half unconscious, half awake, no longer feeling anything, except that she was mounting through the air, floating in it, flying in it, that something was raising her above the earth. From time to time she heard the loud laughter, the noisy voice of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> in her ear; she half opened her eyes; then below her she confusedly beheld <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> checkered with its thousand roofs of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slate" property="schema:name">slate</span> and tiles, like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> and blue <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mosaic" property="schema:name">mosaic</span>, above her head the frightful and joyous face of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. Then her eyelids drooped again; she thought that all was over, that they had executed her during her swoon, and that the misshapen spirit which had presided over her destiny, had laid hold of her and was bearing her away. She dared not look at him, and she surrendered herself to her fate. But when the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span>, dishevelled and panting, had deposited her in the cell of refuge, when she felt his huge hands gently detaching the cord which bruised her arms, she felt that sort of shock which awakens with a start the passengers of a vessel which runs aground in the middle of a dark night. Her thoughts awoke also, and returned to her one by one. She saw that she was in Notre-Dame; she remembered having been torn from the hands of the executioner; that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> was alive, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> loved her no longer; and as these two ideas, one of which shed so much bitterness over the other, presented themselves simultaneously to the poor condemned girl; she turned to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, who was standing in front of her, and who terrified her; she said to him,—"Why have you saved me?"</p>
<p>He gazed at her with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anxiety" property="schema:name">anxiety</span>, as though seeking to divine what she was saying to him. She repeated her question. Then he gave her a profoundly sorrowful glance and fled. She was astonished.</p>
<p>A few moments later he returned, bearing a package which he cast at her feet. It was clothing which some charitable women had left on the threshold of the church for her.</p>
<p>Then she dropped her eyes upon herself and saw that she was almost naked, and blushed. Life had returned.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> appeared to experience something of this modesty. He covered his eyes with his large hand and retired once more, but slowly.</p>
<p>She made haste to dress herself. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Robe_(film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">The robe</span> was a white one with a white veil,—the garb of a novice of the Hôtel-Dien.</p>
<p>She had barely finished when she beheld <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> returning. He carried a basket under one arm and a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mattress" property="schema:name">mattress</span> under the other. In the basket there was a bottle, bread, and some provisions. He set the basket on the floor and said, "Eat!" He spread the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mattress" property="schema:name">mattress</span> on the flagging and said, "Sleep."</p>
<p>It was his own repast, it was his own bed, which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> had gone in search of.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> raised her eyes to thank him, but she could not articulate a word. She dropped her head with a quiver of terror.</p>
<p>Then he said to her.—</p>
<p>"I frighten you. I am very ugly, am I not? Do not look at me; only listen to me. During the day you will remain here; at night you can walk all over the church. But do not leave the church either by day or by night. You would be lost. They would kill you, and I should die."</p>
<p>She was touched and raised her head to answer him. He had disappeared. She found herself alone once more, meditating upon the singular words of this almost monstrous being, and struck by the sound of his voice, which was so hoarse yet so gentle.</p>
<p>Then she examined her cell. It was a chamber about six feet square, with a small window and a door on the slightly sloping plane of the roof formed of flat stones. Many gutters with the figures of animals seemed to be bending down around her, and stretching their necks in order to stare at her through the window. Over the edge of her roof she perceived the tops of thousands of chimneys which caused the smoke of all the fires in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> to rise beneath her eyes. A sad sight for the poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, a foundling, condemned to death, an unhap<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pinyin" property="schema:name">py</span> creature, without country, without family, without a hearthstone.</p>
<p>At the moment when the thought of her isolation thus appeared to her more poignant than ever, she felt a bearded and hairy head glide between her hands, upon her knees. She started (everything alarmed her now) and looked. It was the poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, the agile Djali, which had made its escape after her, at the moment when <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had put to flight Charmolue's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brigade" property="schema:name">brigade</span>, and which had been lavishing caresses on her feet for nearly an hour past, without being able to win a glance. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> covered him with kisses.</p>
<p>"Oh! Djali!" she said, "how I have forgotten thee! And so thou still thinkest of me! Oh! thou art not an ingrate!"</p>
<p>At the same time, as though an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Invisible_hand" property="schema:name">invisible hand</span> had lifted the weight which had repressed her tears in her heart for so long, she began to weep, and, in proportion as her tears flowed, she felt all that was most acrid and bitter in her grief depart with them.</p>
<p>Evening came, she thought the night so beautiful that she made the circuit of the elevated gallery which surrounds the church. It afforded her some relief, so calm did the earth appear when viewed from that height.</p>

<p>On the following morning, she perceived on awaking, that she had been asleep. This singular thing astonished her. She had been so long unaccustomed to sleep! A joyous ray of the rising sun entered through her window and touched her face. At the same time with the sun, she beheld at that window an object which frightened her, the unfortunate face of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. She involuntarily closed her eyes again, but in vain; she fancied that she still saw through the rosy lids that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gnome" property="schema:name">gnome</span>'s mask, one-eyed and gap-toothed. Then, while she still kept her eyes closed, she heard a rough voice saying, very gently,—</p>
<p>"Be not afraid. I am your friend. I came to watch you sleep. It does not hurt you if I come to see you sleep, does it? What difference does it make to you if I am here when your eyes are closed! Now I am going. Stay, I have placed myself behind the wall. You can open your eyes again."</p>
<p>There was something more plaintive than these words, and that was the accent in which they were uttered. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, much touched, opened her eyes. He was, in fact, no longer at the window. She approached the opening, and beheld the poor hunchback crouching in an angle of the wall, in a sad and resigned attitude. She made an effort to surmount the repugnance with which he inspired her. "Come," she said to him gently. From the movement of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s lips, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> thought that she was driving him away; then he rose and retired limping, slowly, with drooping head, without even daring to raise to the young girl his gaze full of despair. "Do come," she cried, but he continued to retreat. Then she darted from her cell, ran to him, and grasped his arm. On feeling her touch him, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> trembled in every limb. He raised his suppliant eye, and seeing that she was leading him back to her quarters, his whole face beamed with joy and tenderness. She tried to make him enter the cell; but he persisted in remaining on the threshold. "No, no," said he; "the owl enters not the nest of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lark" property="schema:name">lark</span>."</p>
<p>Then she crouched down gracefully on her couch, with her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> asleep at her feet. Both remained motionless for several moments, considering in silence, she so much <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_grace" property="schema:name">grace</span>, he so much ugliness. Every moment she discovered some fresh deformity in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. Her glance travelled from his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genu_valgum" property="schema:name">knock knees</span> to his humped back, from his humped back to his only eye. She could not comprehend the existence of a being so awkwardly fashioned. Yet there was so much sadness and so much gentleness spread over all this, that she began to become reconciled to it.</p>
<p>He was the first to break the silence. "So you were telling me to return?"</p>
<p>She made an affirmative sign of the head, and said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He understood the motion of the head. "Alas!" he said, as though hesitating whether to finish, "I am—I am <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>."</p>
<p>"Poor man!" exclaimed the Bohemian, with an expression of kindly pity.</p>
<p>He began to smile sadly.</p>
<p>"You think that that was all that I lacked, do you not? Yes, I am <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>, that is the way I am made. 'Tis horrible, is it not? You are so beautiful!"</p>
<p>There lay in the accents of the wretched man so profound a consciousness of his misery, that she had not the strength to say a word. Besides, he would not have heard her. He went on,—</p>
<p>"Never have I seen my ugliness as at the present moment. When I compare myself to you, I feel a very great pity for myself, poor unhappy monster that I am! Tell me, I must look to you like a beast. You, you are a ray of sunshine, a drop of dew, the song of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Finger_(gesture)" property="schema:name">bird</span>! I am something frightful, neither man nor animal, I know not what, harder, more trampled under foot, and more unshapely than a pebble stone!"</p>
<p>Then he began to laugh, and that laugh was the most heartbreaking thing in the world. He continued,—</p>
<p>"Yes, I am <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>; but you shall talk to me by gestures, by signs. I have a master who talks with me in that way. And then, I shall very soon know your wish from the movement of your lips, from your look."</p>
<p>"Well!" she interposed with a smile, "tell me why you saved me."</p>
<p>He watched her attentively while she was speaking.</p>
<p>"I understand," he replied. "You ask me why I saved you. You have forgotten a wretch who tried to abduct you one night, a wretch to whom you rendered succor on the following day on their infamous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>. A drop of water and a little pity,—that is more than I can repay with my life. You have forgotten that wretch; but he remembers it."</p>
<p>She listened to him with profound tenderness. A tear swam in the eye of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span>, but did not fall. He seemed to make it a sort of point of honor to retain it.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Listen_(Beyoncé_Knowles_song)" property="schema:name">Listen</span>," he resumed, when he was no longer afraid that the tear would escape; "our towers here are very high, a man who should fall from them would be dead before touching the pavement; when it shall please you to have me fall, you will not have to utter even a word, a glance will suffice."</p>
<p>Then he rose. Unhappy as was the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemianism" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span>, this eccentric being still aroused some compassion in her. She made him a sign to remain.</p>
<p>"No, no," said he; "I must not remain too long. I am not at my ease. It is out of pity that you do not turn away your eyes. I shall go to some place where I can see you without your seeing me: it will be better so."</p>
<p>He drew from his pocket a little metal whistle.</p>
<p>"Here," said he, "when you have need of me, when you wish me to come, when you will not feel too ranch <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horror_film" property="schema:name">horror</span> at the sight of me, use this whistle. I can hear this sound."</p>
<p>He laid the whistle on the floor and fled.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00061">CHAPTER IV. EARTHENWARE AND CRYSTAL.</h2>
<p>Day followed day. Calm gradually returned to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span>. Excess of grief, like excess of joy is a violent thing which lasts but a short time. The heart of man cannot remain long in one extremity. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> had suffered so much, that nothing was left her but astonishment. With security, hope had returned to her. She was outside the pale of society, outside the pale of life, but she had a vague feeling that it might not be impossible to return to it. She was like a dead person, who should hold in reserve the key to her tomb.</p>
<p>She felt the terrible images which had so long persecuted her, gradually departing. All the hideous phantoms, Pierrat Torterue, Jacques Charmolue, were effaced from her mind, all, even the priest.</p>
<p>And then, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> was alive; she was sure of it, she had seen him. To her the fact of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> being alive was everything. After the series of fatal shocks which had overturned everything within her, she had found but one thing intact in her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, one sentiment,—her love for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>. Love is like a tree; it sprouts forth of itself, sends its roots out deeply through our whole being, and often continues to flourish greenly over a heart in ruins.</p>
<p>And the inexplicable point about it is that the more blind is this passion, the more tenacious it is. It is never more solid than when it has no reason in it.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">La Esmeralda</span> did not think of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> without bitterness, no doubt. No doubt it was terrible that he also should have been deceived; that he should have believed that impossible thing, that he could have conceived of a stab dealt by her who would have given a thousand lives for him. But, after all, she must not be too angry with him for it; had she not confessed her crime? had she not yielded, weak woman that she was, to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Torture" property="schema:name">torture</span>? The fault was entirely hers. She should have allowed her finger <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nail_(anatomy)" property="schema:name">nails</span> to be torn out rather than such a word to be wrenched from her. In short, if she could but see <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> once more, for a single minute, only one word would be required, one look, in order to undeceive him, to bring him back. She did not doubt it. She was astonished also at many singular things, at the accident of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>'s presence on the day of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Penance" property="schema:name">penance</span>, at the young girl with whom he had been. She was his sister, no doubt. An unreasonable explanation, but she contented herself with it, because she needed to believe that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> still loved her, and loved her alone. Had he not sworn it to her? What more was needed, simple and credulous as she was? And then, in this matter, were not appearances much more against her than against him? Accordingly, she waited. She hoped.</p>
<p>Let us add that the church, that vast church, which surrounded her on every side, which guarded her, which saved her, was itself a sovereign <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tranquilizer" property="schema:name">tranquillizer</span>. The solemn lines of that architecture, the religious attitude of all the objects which surrounded the young girl, the serene and pious thoughts which emanated, so to speak, from all the pores of that stone, acted upon her without her being aware of it. The edifice had also sounds fraught with such <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benediction" property="schema:name">benediction</span> and such majesty, that they soothed this ailing <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>. The monotonous chanting of the celebrants, the responses of the people to the priest, sometimes inarticulate, sometimes thunderous, the harmonious trembling of the painted windows, the organ, bursting forth like a hundred <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trumpet" property="schema:name">trumpets</span>, the three <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">belfries</span>, humming like <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beehive" property="schema:name">hives</span> of huge bees, that whole <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra" property="schema:name">orchestra</span> on which bounded a gigantic scale, ascending, descending incessantly from the voice of a throng to that of one bell, dulled her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span>, her imagination, her grief. The bells, in particular, lulled her. It was something like a powerful <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magnetism" property="schema:name">magnetism</span> which those vast instruments shed over her in great waves.</p>
<p>Thus <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electronvolt" property="schema:name">ev</span>ery sunrise found her more calm, breathing better, less pale. In proportion as her inward wounds closed, her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_grace" property="schema:name">grace</span> and beauty blossomed once more on her countenance, but more thoughtful, more reposeful. Her former character also returned to her, somewhat even of her gayety, her pretty pout, her love for her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, her love for singing, her modesty. She took care to dress herself in the morning in the corner of her cell for fear some inhabitants of the neighboring attics might see her through the window.</p>
<p>When the thought of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> left her time, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> sometimes thought of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. He was the sole bond, the sole connection, the sole communication which remained to her with men, with the living. Unfortunate girl! she was more outside the world than <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. She understood not in the least the strange friend whom chance had given her. She often reproached herself for not feeling a gratitude which should close her eyes, but decidedly, she could not accustom herself to the poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span>. He was too ugly.</p>
<p>She had left the whistle which he had given her lying on the ground. This did not prevent <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> from making his appearance from time to time during the first few days. She did her best not to turn aside with too much repugnance when he came to bring her her basket of provisions or her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jug_band" property="schema:name">jug</span> of water, but he always perceived the slightest movement of this sort, and then he withdrew sadly.</p>
<p>Once he came at the moment when she was caressing Djali. He stood pensively for several minutes before this graceful group of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>; at last he said, shaking his heavy and ill-formed head,—</p>
<p>"My misfortune is that I still resemble a man too much. I should like to be wholly a beast like that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>."</p>
<p>She gazed at him in amazement.</p>
<p>He replied to the glance,—</p>
<p>"Oh! I well know why," and he went away.</p>
<p>On another occasion he presented himself at the door of the cell (which he never entered) at the moment when <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span> was singing an old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spanish_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Spanish</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ballad" property="schema:name">ballad</span>, the words of which she did not understand, but which had lingered in her ear because the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> women had lulled her to sleep with it when she was a little child. At the sight of that villanous form which made its appearance so abruptly in the middle of her song, the young girl paused with an involuntary gesture of alarm. The unhappy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> fell upon his knees on the threshold, and clasped his large, misshapen hands with a suppliant air. "Oh!" he said, sorrowfully, "continue, I implore you, and do not drive me away." She did not wish to pain him, and resumed her lay, trembling all over. By degrees, however, her terror disappeared, and she yielded herself wholly to the slow and melancholy air which she was singing. He remained on his knees with hands clasped, as in prayer, attentive, hardly breathing, his gaze riveted upon the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strategic_Defense_Initiative" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">brilliant eyes</span>.</p>
<p>On another occasion, he came to her with an awkward and timid air. "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Listen_(Beyoncé_Knowles_song)" property="schema:name">Listen</span>," he said, with an effort; "I have something to say to you." She made him a sign that she was listening. Then he began to sigh, half opened his lips, appeared for a moment to be on the point of speaking, then he looked at her again, shook his head, and withdrew slowly, with his brow in his hand, leaving the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stupefied" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">stupefied</span>. Among the grotesque personages sculptured on the wall, there was one to whom he was particularly attached, and with which he often seemed to exchange fraternal glances. Once the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> heard him saying to it,—</p>
<p>"Oh! why am not I of stone, like you!"</p>
<p>At last, one morning, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span> had advanced to the edge of the roof, and was looking into the Place over the pointed roof of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Jean</span> le Rond. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was standing behind her. He had placed himself in that position in order to spare the young girl, as far as possible, the displeasure of seeing him. All at once the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> started, a tear and a flash of joy gleamed simultaneously in her eyes, she knelt on the brink of the roof and extended her arms towards the Place with anguish, exclaiming: "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>! come! come! a word, a single word in the name of heaven! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>!" Her voice, her face, her gesture, her whole person bore the heartrending expression of a shipwrecked man who is making a signal of distress to the joyous vessel which is passing <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afar_people" property="schema:name">afar</span> off in a ray of sunlight on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horizon" property="schema:name">horizon</span>.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> leaned over the Place, and saw that the object of this tender and agonizing prayer was a young man, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>, a handsome cavalier all glittering with arms and decorations, prancing across the end of the Place, and saluting with his plume a beautiful lady who was smiling at him from her balcony. However, the officer did not hear the unhappy girl calling him; he was too far away.</p>
<p>But the poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man heard. A profound sigh heaved his breast; he turned round; his heart was swollen with all the tears which he was swallowing; his convulsively-clenched fists struck against his head, and when he withdrew them there was a bunch of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red_hair" property="schema:name">red</span> hair in each hand.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/False_hero" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> paid no heed to him. He said in a low voice as he gnashed his teeth,—</p>
<p>"Damnation! That is what one should be like! 'Tis only necessary to be handsome on the outside!"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, she remained kneeling, and cried with extraor-dinary agitation,—"Oh! there he is alighting from his horse! He is about to enter that house!—<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>!—He does not hear me! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>!—How wicked that woman is to speak to him at the same time with me! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>!"</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man gazed at her. He understood this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pantomime" property="schema:name">pantomime</span>. The poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span>'s eye filled with tears, but he let none fall. All at once he pulled her gently by the border of her sleeve. She turned round. He had assumed a tranquil air; he said to her,—</p>
<p>"Would you like to have me bring him to you?"</p>
<p>She uttered a cry of joy.</p>
<p>"Oh! go! hasten! run! quick! that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>! that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>! bring him to me! I will love you for it!"</p>
<p>She clasped his knees. He could not refrain from shaking his head sadly.</p>
<p>"I will bring him to you," he said, in a weak <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voi" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">voi</span>ce. Then he turned his head and plunged down the staircase with great strides, stifling with sobs.</p>
<p>When he reached the Place, he no longer saw anything except the handsome horse hitched at the door of the Gondelaurier house; the captain had just entered there.</p>
<p>He raised his eyes to the roof of the church. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">La Esmeralda</span> was there in the same spot, in the same attitude. He made her a sad sign with his head; then he planted his back against one of the stone posts of the Gondelaurier porch, determined to wait until the captain should come forth.</p>
<p>In the Gondelaurier house it was one of those gala days which precede a wedding. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> beheld many people enter, but no one come out. He cast a glance towards the roof from time to time; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> did not stir any more than himself. A groom came and unhitched the horse and led it to the stable of the house.</p>
<p>The entire day passed thus, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> at his post, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span> on the roof, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, no doubt, at the feet of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>.</p>
<p>At length night came, a moonless night, a dark night. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> fixed his gaze in vain upon <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span>; soon she was no more than a whiteness amid the twilight; then nothing. All was effaced, all was black.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> beheld the front windows from top to bottom of the Gondelaurier mansion illuminated; he saw the other casements in the Place lighted one by one, he also saw them extinguished to the very last, for he remained the whole evening at his post. The officer did not come forth. When the last passers-by had returned home, when the windows of all the other houses were extinguished, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was left entirely alone, entirely in the dark. There were at that time no lamps in the square before Notre-Dame.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the windows of the Gondelaurier mansion remained lighted, even after midnight. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, motionless and attentive, beheld a throng of lively, dancing shadows pass athwart the many-colored painted panes. Had he not been <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>, he would have heard more and more distinctly, in proportion as the noise of sleeping <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> died away, a sound of feasting, laughter, and music in the Gondelaurier mansion.</p>
<p>Towards one o'clock in the morning, the guests began to take their leave. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, shrouded in darkness watched them all pass out through the porch illuminated with torches. None of them was the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>.</p>
<p>He was filled with sad thoughts; at times he looked upwards into the air, like a person who is weary of waiting. Great black clouds, heavy, torn, split, hung like <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crape" property="schema:name">crape</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hammock" property="schema:name">hammocks</span> beneath the starry <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dome" property="schema:name">dome</span> of night. One would have pronounced them <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider" property="schema:name">spiders</span>' webs of the vault of heaven.</p>
<p>In one of these moments he suddenly beheld the long window on the balcony, whose stone <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span> projected above his head, open mysteriously. The frail glass door gave passage to two persons, and closed noiselessly behind them; it was a man and a woman.</p>
<p>It was not without difficulty that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> succeeded in recognizing in the man the handsome <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>, in the woman the young lady whom he had seen welcome the officer in the morning from that very balcony. The place was perfectly dark, and a double crimson curtain which had fallen across the door the very moment it closed again, allowed no light to reach the balcony from the apartment.</p>
<p>The young man and the young girl, so far as our <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man could judge, without hearing a single one of their words, appeared to abandon themselves to a very tender tête-a-tête. The young girl seemed to have allowed the officer to make a girdle for her of his arm, and gently repulsed a kiss.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> looked on from below at this scene which was all the more pleasing to witness because it was not meant to be seen. He contemplated with bitterness that beauty, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Happiness" property="schema:name">happiness</span>. After all, nature was not dumb in the poor fellow, and his human sensibility, all maliciously contorted as it was, quivered no less than any other. He thought of the miserable portion which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_providence" property="schema:name">Providence</span> had allotted to him; that woman and the pleasure of love, would pass forever before his eyes, and that he should never do anything but behold the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Felicity_(TV_series)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">felicity</span> of others. But that which rent his heart most in this sight, that which mingled indignation with his anger, was the thought of what the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> would suffer could she behold it. It is true that the night was very dark, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span>, if she had remained at her post (and he had no doubt of this), was very far away, and that it was all that he himself could do to distinguish the lovers on the balcony. This consoled him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, their conversation grew more and more animated. The young lady appeared to be entreating the officer to ask nothing more of her. Of all this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> could distinguish only the beautiful clasped hands, the smiles mingled with tears, the young girl's glances directed to the stars, the eyes of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> lowered ardently upon her.</p>
<p>Fortunately, for the young girl was beginning to resist but feebly, the door of the balcony suddenly opened once more and an old dame appeared; the beauty seemed confused, the officer assumed an air of displeasure, and all three withdrew.</p>
<p>A moment later, a horse was champing his bit under the porch, and the brilliant officer, enveloped in his night cloak, passed rapidly before <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> allowed him to turn the corner of the street, then he ran after him with his ape-like agility, shouting: "Hey there! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>!"</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> halted.</p>
<p>"What wants this knave with me?" he said, catching sight through the gloom of that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Detuner" property="schema:name">hipshot</span> form which ran limping after him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had caught up with him, and had boldly grasped his horse's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bridle" property="schema:name">bridle</span>: "Follow me, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>; there is one here who desires to speak with you!</p>
<p>"<i>Cornemahom</i>!" grumbled <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, "here's a villanous; ruffled <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">bird</span> which I fancy I have seen somewhere. Holà master, will you let my horse's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bridle" property="schema:name">bridle</span> alone?"</p>
<p>"Captain," replied the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man, "do you not ask me who it is?"</p>
<p>"I tell you to release my horse," retorted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, impatiently. "What means the knave by clinging to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bridle" property="schema:name">bridle</span> of my steed? Do you take my horse for a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hanging" property="schema:name">gallows</span>?"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, far from releasing the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bridle" property="schema:name">bridle</span>, prepared to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span> him to retrace his steps. Unable to comprehend the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(United_States)" property="schema:name">captain</span>'s resistance, he hastened to say to him,—</p>
<p>"Come, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(United_States)" property="schema:name">captain</span>, 'tis a woman who is waiting for you." He added with an effort: "A woman who loves you."</p>
<p>"A rare rascal!" said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(United_States)" property="schema:name">captain</span>, "who thinks me obliged to go to all the women who love me! or who say they do. And what if, by chance, she should resemble you, you face of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Screech_owl" property="schema:name">screech-owl</span>? Tell the woman who has sent you that I am about to marry, and that she may go to the devil!"</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Listen_(Beyoncé_Knowles_song)" property="schema:name">Listen</span>," exclaimed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, thinking to overcome his hesitation with a word, "come, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monsignor" property="schema:name">monseigneur</span>! 'tis the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> whom you know!"</p>
<p>This word did, indeed, produce a great effect on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, but not of the kind which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man expected. It will be remembered that our gallant officer had retired with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> several moments before <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had rescued the condemned girl from the hands of Charmolue. Afterwards, in all his visits to the Gondelaurier mansion he had taken care not to mention that woman, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span> of whom was, after all, painful to him; and on her side, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> had not deemed it politic to tell him that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> was alive. Hence <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> believed poor "Similar" to be dead, and that a month or two had elapsed since her death. Let us add that for the last few moments the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(United_States)" property="schema:name">captain</span> had been reflecting on the profound darkness of the night, the supernatural ugliness, the sepulchral voice of the strange messenger; that it was past midnight; that the street was deserted, as on the evening when the surly monk had accosted him; and that his horse snorted as it looked at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>.</p>
<p>"The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/False_hero" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>!" he exclaimed, almost frightened. "Look here, do you come from the other world?"</p>
<p>And he laid his hand on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sword" property="schema:name">hilt</span> of his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dagger" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">dagger</span>.</p>
<p>"Quick, quick," said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man, endeavoring to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drag_(clothing)" property="schema:name">drag</span> the horse along; "this way!"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> dealt him a vigorous kick in the breast.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>'s eye flashed. He made a motion to fling himself on the captain. Then he drew himself up stiffly and said,—</p>
<p>"Oh! how happy you are to have some one who loves you!"</p>
<p>He emphasized the words "some one," and loosing the horse's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bridle" property="schema:name">bridle</span>,—</p>
<p>"Begone!"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> spurred on in all haste, swearing. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> watched him disappear in the shades of the street.</p>
<p>"Oh!" said the poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man, in a very low voice; "to refuse that!"</p>
<p>He re-entered Notre-Dame, lighted his lamp and climbed to the tower again. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/False_hero" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> was still in the same place, as he had supposed.</p>
<p>She flew to meet him as far off as she could see him. "Alone!" she cried, clasping her beautiful hands sorrowfully.</p>
<p>"I could not find him," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> coldly.</p>
<p>"You should have waited all night," she said angrily.</p>
<p>He saw her gesture of wrath, and understood the reproach.</p>
<p>"I will lie in wait for him better another time," he said, dropping his head.</p>
<p>"Begone!" she said to him.</p>
<p>He left her. She was displeased with him. He preferred to have her abuse him rather than to have afflicted her. He had kept all the pain to himself.</p>
<p>From that day forth, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> no longer saw him. He ceased to come to her cell. At the most she occasionally caught a glimpse at the summit of the towers, of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span>'s face turned sadly to her. But as soon as she perceived him, he disappeared.</p>
<p>We must admit that she was not much grieved by this voluntary absence on the part of the poor hunchback. At the bottom of her heart she was grateful to him for it. Moreover, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> did not deceive himself on this point.</p>
<p>She no longer saw him, but she felt the presence of a good genius about her. Her provisions were replenished by an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Invisible_hand" property="schema:name">invisible hand</span> during her slumbers. One morning she found a cage of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">birds</span> on her window. There was a piece of sculpture above her window which frightened her. She had shown this more than once in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>'s presence. One morning, for all these things happened at night, she no longer saw it, it had been broken. The person who had climbed up to that carving must have risked his life.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in the evening, she heard a voice, concealed beneath the wind screen of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell tower</span>, singing a sad, strange song, as though to lull her to sleep. The lines were unrhymed, such as a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> person can make.</p></body></html>
