<body prefix="schema: http://schema.org/"><div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  Peter the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_animals_of_the_Edge_Chronicles" property="schema:name">Slaughterer</span>; and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baptism" property="schema:name">Baptist</span> Crack-Gosling.<br/></div>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zachlumia" property="schema:name">Hum</span>," said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>; "those are names as fit for a good work as a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catapult" property="schema:name">catapult</span> for the chief altar."</p>
<p>It is certain that Jehan had made a very bad choice of names for his two friends. He realized it too late.</p>
<p>"And then," pursued the sagacious Claude, "what sort of an infant's outfit is it that is to cost three forms, and that for the child of a Haudriette? Since when have the Haudriette widows taken to having babes in swaddling-clothes?"</p>
<p>Jehan broke the ice once more.</p>
<p>"Eh, well! yes! I need money in order to go and see Isabeau la Thierrye to-night; in the Val-d' Amour!"</p>
<p>"Impure wretch!" exclaimed the priest.</p>
<p>"<i>Avayveia</i>!" said Jehan.</p>
<p>This quotation, which the scholar borrowed with malice, perchance, from the wall of the cell, produced a singular effect on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>. He bit his lips and his wrath was drowned in a crimson flush.</p>
<p>"Begone," he said to Jehan. "I am expecting some one."</p>
<p>The scholar made one more effort.</p>
<p>"Brother Claude, give me at least one little parisis to buy something to eat."</p>
<p>"How far have you gone in the Decretals of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gratian" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Gratian</span>?" demanded Dom Claude.</p>
<p>"I have lost my copy books.</p>
<p>"Where are you in your <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Humanities" property="schema:name">humanities</span>?"</p>
<p>"My copy of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Horace</span> has been stolen."</p>
<p>"Where are you in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Aristotle</span>?"</p>
<p>"I' faith! brother what father of the church is it, who says that the errors of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heresy" property="schema:name">heretics</span> have always had for their lurking place the thickets of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Aristotle</span>'s <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metaphysics" property="schema:name">metaphysics</span>? A plague on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Aristotle</span>! I care not to tear my religion on his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metaphysics" property="schema:name">metaphysics</span>."</p>
<p>"Young man," resumed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, "at the king's last entry, there was a young gentleman, named <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philippe_de_Commines" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Philippe de Comines</span>, who wore embroidered on the housings of his horse this device, upon which I counsel you to meditate: <i>Qui non laborat, non manducet</i>."</p>
<p>The scholar remained <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span> for a moment, with his finger in his ear, his eyes on the ground, and a discomfited <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yao_people" property="schema:name">mien</span>.</p>
<p>All at once he turned round to Claude with the agile quickness of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wagtail" property="schema:name">wagtail</span>.</p>
<p>"So, my good brother, you refuse me a sou parisis, wherewith to buy a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bread" property="schema:name">crust</span> at a baker's shop?"</p>
<p>"<i>Qui non laborat, non manducet</i>."</p>
<p>At this response of the inflexible <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, Jehan hid his head in his hands, like a woman sobbing, and exclaimed with an expression of despair: "<i>Orororororoi</i>."</p>
<p>"What is the meaning of this, sir?" demanded Claude, surprised at this freak.</p>
<p>"What indeed!" said the scholar; and he lifted to Claude his impudent eyes into which he had just thrust his fists in order to communicate to them the redness of tears; "'tis <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Greek</span>! 'tis an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anapaest" property="schema:name">anapaest</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aeschylus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">AEschylus</span> which expresses grief perfectly."</p>
<p>And here he burst into a laugh so droll and violent that it made the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> smile. It was Claude's fault, in fact: why had he so spoiled that child?</p>
<p>"Oh! good Brother Claude," resumed Jehan, emboldened by this smile, "look at my worn out boots. Is there a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buskin" property="schema:name">cothurnus</span> in the world more tragic than these boots, whose soles are hanging out their tongues?"</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> promptly returned to his original severity.</p>
<p>"I will send you some new boots, but no money."</p>
<p>"Only a poor little parisis, brother," continued the suppliant Jehan. "I will learn <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decretum_Gratiani" property="schema:name">Gratian</span> by heart, I will believe firmly in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>, I will be a regular <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pythagoras" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Pythagoras</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span> and virtue. But one little parisis, in mercy! Would you have <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Famine" property="schema:name">famine</span> bite me with its jaws which are gaping in front of me, blacker, deeper, and more noisome than a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tartarus" property="schema:name">Tartarus</span> or the nose of a monk?"</p>
<p>Dom Claude shook his wrinkled head: "<i>Qui non laborat</i>—"</p>
<p>Jehan did not allow him to finish.</p>
<p>"Well," he exclaimed, "to the devil then! Long live joy! I will live in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tavern" property="schema:name">tavern</span>, I will fight, I will break pots and I will go and see the wenches." And thereupon, he hurled his cap at the wall, and snapped his fingers like <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castanets" property="schema:name">castanets</span>.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> surveyed him with a gloomy air.</p>
<p>"Jehan, you have no <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>."</p>
<p>"In that case, according to Epicurius, I lack a something made of another something which has no name."</p>
<p>"Jehan, you must think seriously of amending your ways."</p>
<p>"Oh, come now," cried the student, gazing in turn at his brother and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alembic" property="schema:name">alembics</span> on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span>, "everything is preposterous here, both ideas and bottles!"</p>
<p>"Jehan, you are on a very slippery downward road. Do you know whither you are going?"</p>
<p>"To the wine-shop," said Jehan.</p>
<p>"The wine-shop leads to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>."</p>
<p>"'Tis as good a lantern as any other, and perchance with that one, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diogenes_of_Sinope" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Diogenes</span> would have found his man."</p>
<p>"The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span> leads to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallows" property="schema:name">gallows</span>."</p>
<p>"The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallows" property="schema:name">gallows</span> is a balance which has a man at one end and the whole earth at the other. 'Tis fine to be the man."</p>
<p>"The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallows" property="schema:name">gallows</span> leads to hell."</p>
<p>"'Tis a big fire.".</p>
<p>"Jehan, Jehan, the end will be bad."</p>
<p>"The beginning will have been good."</p>
<p>At that moment, the sound of a footstep was heard on the staircase.</p>
<p>"Silence!" said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, laying his finger on his mouth, "here is Master Jacques. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Listen_(Beyoncé_Knowles_song)" property="schema:name">Listen</span>, Jehan," he added, in a low voice; "have a care never to speak of what you shall have seen or heard here. Hide yourself quickly under the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span>, and do not breathe."</p>
<p>The scholar concealed himself; just then a happy idea occurred to him.</p>
<p>"By the way, Brother Claude, a form for not breathing."</p>
<p>"Silence! I promise."</p>
<p>"You must give it to me."</p>
<p>"Take it, then!" said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> angrily, flinging his purse at him.</p>
<p>Jehan darted under the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span> again, and the door opened.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00046">CHAPTER <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/V." typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">V.</span> THE TWO MEN CLOTHED IN BLACK.</h2>
<p>The personage who entered wore a black gown and a gloomy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yao_people" property="schema:name">mien</span>. The first point which struck the eye of our Jehan (who, as the reader will readily surmise, had ensconced himself in his nook in such a manner as to enable him to see and hear everything at his good pleasure) was the perfect sadness of the garments and the visage of this new-corner. There was, nevertheless, some sweetness diffused over that face, but it was the sweetness of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" property="schema:name">cat</span> or a judge, an affected, treacherous sweetness. He was very gray and wrinkled, and not far from his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/60th_United_States_Congress" property="schema:name">sixtieth</span> year, his eyes blinked, his eyebrows were white, his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lip" property="schema:name">lip</span> pendulous, and his hands large. When Jehan saw that it was only this, that is to say, no doubt a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span> or a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magistrate" property="schema:name">magistrate</span>, and that this man had a nose very far from his mouth, a sign of stupidity, he nestled down in his hole, in despair at being obliged to pass an indefinite time in such an uncomfortable attitude, and in such <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bad_Company_(drum_and_bass_group)" property="schema:name">bad company</span>.</p>
<p>The archdeacon, in the meantime, had not even risen to receive this personage. He had made the latter a sign to seat himself on a stool near the door, and, after several moments of a silence which appeared to be a continuation of a preceding <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Meditation" property="schema:name">meditation</span>, he said to him in a rather patronizing way, "Good day, Master Jacques."</p>
<p>"Greeting, master," replied the man in black.</p>
<p>There was in the two ways in which "Master Jacques" was pronounced on the one hand, and the "master" by preeminence on the other, the difference between <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monsignor" property="schema:name">monseigneur</span> and monsieur, between <i>domine</i> and <i>domne</i>. It was evidently the meeting of a teacher and a disciple.</p>
<p>"Well!" resumed the archdeacon, after a fresh silence which Master Jacques took good care not to disturb, "how are you succeeding?"</p>
<p>"Alas! master," said the other, with a sad smile, "I am still seeking the stone. Plenty of ashes. But not a spark of gold."</p>
<p>Dom Claude made a gesture of impatience. "I am not talking to you of that, Master Jacques Charmolue, but of the trial of your <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magician</span>. Is it not Marc Cenaine that you call him? the butler of the Court of Accounts? Does he confess his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witchcraft</span>? Have you been successful with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Torture" property="schema:name">torture</span>?"</p>
<p>"Alas! no," replied Master Jacques, still with his sad smile; "we have not that consolation. That man is a stone. We might have him boiled in the Marché aux Pourceaux, before he would say anything. Nevertheless, we are sparing nothing for the sake of getting at the truth; he is already thoroughly dislocated, we are applying all the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herbalism" property="schema:name">herbs</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_the_Baptist" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint John</span>'s day; as saith the old comedian <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plautus" property="schema:name">Plautus</span>,—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">        <i>'Advorsum stimulos, laminas, crucesque, compedesque,<br/>        Nerros, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catena_(biblical_commentary)" property="schema:name">catenas</span>, carceres, numellas, pedicas, boias</i>.'<br/></div>
<p>Nothing answers; that man is terrible. I am at my wit's end over him."</p>
<p>"You have found nothing new in his house?"</p>
<p>"I' faith, yes," said Master Jacques, fumbling in his pouch; "this parchment. There are words in it which we cannot comprehend. The criminal advocate, Monsieur Philippe Lheulier, nevertheless, knows a little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hebrew_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Hebrew</span>, which he learned in that matter of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jews" property="schema:name">Jews</span> of the Rue Kantersten, at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brussels" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Brussels</span>."</p>
<p>So saying, Master Jacques unrolled a parchment. "Give it here," said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>. And casting his eyes upon this writing: "Pure <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span>, Master Jacques!" he exclaimed. "'Emen-Hétan!' 'Tis the cry of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vampire" property="schema:name">vampires</span> when they arrive at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witches'_Sabbath" property="schema:name">witches' sabbath</span>. <i>Per ipsum, et cum ipso, et in ipso</i>! 'Tis the command which chains the devil in hell. <i>Hax, pax, max</i>! that refers to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medicine" property="schema:name">medicine</span>. A formula against the bite of mad dogs. Master Jacques! you are <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Procurator_(Roman)" property="schema:name">procurator</span> to the king in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ecclesiastical_court" property="schema:name">Ecclesiastical Courts</span>: this parchment is abominable."</p>
<p>"We will put the man to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Torture" property="schema:name">torture</span> once more. Here again," added Master Jacques, fumbling afresh in his pouch, "is something that we have found at Marc Cenaine's house."</p>
<p>It was a vessel belonging to the same family as those which covered Dom Claude's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span>.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, "a crucible for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alchemy" property="schema:name">alchemy</span>."</p>
<p>"I will confess to you," continued Master Jacques, with his timid and awkward smile, "that I have tried it over the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span>, but I have succeeded no better than with my own."</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> began an examination of the vessel. "What has he engraved on his crucible? <i>Och! och</i>! the word which expels <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flea" property="schema:name">fleas</span>! That Marc Cenaine is an ignoramus! I verily believe that you will never make gold with this! 'Tis good to set in your bedroom in summer and that is all!"</p>
<p>"Since we are talking about errors," said the king's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Procurator_(Roman)" property="schema:name">procurator</span>, "I have just been studying the figures on the portal below before ascending hither; is your reverence quite sure that the opening of the work of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physics" property="schema:name">physics</span> is there portrayed on the side towards the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hôtel-Dieu_de_Paris" property="schema:name">Hôtel-Dieu</span>, and that among the seven nude figures which stand at the feet of Notre-Dame, that which has wings on his heels is Mercurius?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the priest; "'tis Augustin Nypho who writes it, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Italian</span> doctor who had a bearded demon who acquainted him with all things. However, we will descend, and I will explain it to you with the text before us."</p>
<p>"Thanks, master," said Charmolue, bowing to the earth. "By the way, I was on the point of forgetting. When doth it please you that I shall apprehend the little sorceress?"</p>
<p>"What sorceress?"</p>
<p>"That <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> girl you know, who comes every day to dance on the church square, in spite of the official's prohibition! She hath a demoniac <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> with horns of the devil, which reads, which writes, which knows <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mathematics" property="schema:name">mathematics</span> like Picatrix, and which would suffice to hang all <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bohemia</span>. The prosecution is all ready; '<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Twill" property="schema:name">twill</span> soon be finished, I assure you! A pretty creature, on my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, that dancer! The handsomest black eyes! Two <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egyptian</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carbuncle_(gemstone)" property="schema:name">carbuncles</span>! When shall we begin?"</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> was excessively pale.</p>
<p>"I will tell you that hereafter," he stammered, in a voice that was barely articulate; then he resumed with an effort, "Busy yourself with Marc Cenaine."</p>
<p>"Be at ease," said Charmolue with a smile; "I'll buckle him down again for you on the leather bed when I get home. But 'tis a devil of a man; he wearies even Pierrat Torterue himself, who hath hands larger than my own. As that good <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plautus" property="schema:name">Plautus</span> saith,—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">         '<i>Nudus vinctus, centum <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pondo_people" property="schema:name">pondo</span>,<br/>          es quando pendes per pedes</i>.'<br/></div>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Torture" property="schema:name">torture</span> of the wheel and axle! 'Tis the most effectual! He shall taste it!"</p>
<p>Dom Claude seemed absorbed in gloomy abstraction. He turned to Charmolue,—</p>
<p>"Master Pierrat—Master Jacques, I mean, busy yourself with Marc Cenaine."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, Dom Claude. Poor man! he will have suffered like Mummol. What an idea to go to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witches'_Sabbath" property="schema:name">witches' sabbath</span>! a butler of the Court of Accounts, who ought to know <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charlemagne</span>'s text; <i>Stryga vel masea</i>!—In the matter of the little girl,—Smelarda, as they call her,—I will await your orders. Ah! as we pass through the portal, you will explain to me also the meaning of the gardener painted in relief, which one sees as one enters the church. Is it not the Sower? Hé! master, of what are you thinking, pray?"</p>
<p>Dom Claude, buried in his own thoughts, no longer listened to him. Charmolue, following the direction of his glance, perceived that it was fixed mechanically on the great <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider" property="schema:name">spider</span>'s web which draped the window. At that moment, a bewildered fly which was seeking the March sun, flung itself through the net and became entangled there. On the agitation of his web, the enormous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider" property="schema:name">spider</span> made an abrupt move from his central cell, then with one bound, rushed upon the fly, which he folded together with his fore <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antenna_(biology)" property="schema:name">antennae</span>, while his hideous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proboscis" property="schema:name">proboscis</span> dug into the victim's bead. "Poor fly!" said the king's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Procurator_(Roman)" property="schema:name">procurator</span> in the ecclesiastical court; and he raised his hand to save it. The archdeacon, as though roused with a start, withheld his arm with convulsive violence.</p>
<p>"Master Jacques," he cried, "let fate take its course!" The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Procurator_(Roman)" property="schema:name">procurator</span> wheeled round in affright; it seemed to him that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claw" property="schema:name">pincers</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> had clutched his arm. The priest's eye was staring, wild, flaming, and remained riveted on the horrible little group of the spider and the fly.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes!" continued the priest, in a voice which seemed to proceed from the depths of his being, "behold here a symbol of all. She flies, she is joyous, she is just born; she seeks the spring, the open air, liberty: oh, yes! but let her come in contact with the fatal network, and the spider issues from it, the hideous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider" property="schema:name">spider</span>! Poor dancer! poor, predestined fly! Let things take their course, Master Jacques, 'tis fate! Alas! Claude, thou art the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider" property="schema:name">spider</span>! Claude, thou art the fly also! Thou wert flying towards learning, light, the sun. Thou hadst no other care than to reach the open air, the full daylight of eternal truth; but in precipitating thyself towards the dazzling window which opens upon the other world,—upon the world of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apparent_magnitude" property="schema:name">brightness</span>, intelligence, and science—blind fly! senseless, learned man! thou hast not perceived that subtle <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider" property="schema:name">spider</span>'s web, stretched by destiny betwixt the light and thee—thou hast flung thyself headlong into it, and now thou art struggling with head broken and mangled wings between the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antenna_(biology)" property="schema:name">antennae</span> of fate! Master Jacques! Master Jacques! let the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider" property="schema:name">spider</span> work its will!"</p>
<p>"I assure you," said Charmolue, who was gazing at him without comprehending him, "that I will not touch it. But release my arm, master, for pity's sake! You have a hand like a pair of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chela_(organ)" property="schema:name">pincers</span>."</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> did not hear him. "Oh, madman!" he went on, without removing his gaze from the window. "And even couldst thou have broken through that formidable web, with thy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gnat" property="schema:name">gnat</span>'s wings, thou believest that thou couldst have reached the light? Alas! that pane of glass which is further on, that transparent obstacle, that wall of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crore" property="schema:name">cr</span>ystal, harder than <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brass" property="schema:name">brass</span>, which separates all philosophies from the truth, how wouldst thou have overcome it? Oh, vanity of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span>! how many wise men come flying from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afar_people" property="schema:name">afar</span>, to dash their heads against thee! How many systems vainly fling themselves buzzing against that eternal pane!"</p>
<p>He became <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span>. These last ideas, which had gradually led him back from himself to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span>, appeared to have calmed him. Jacques Charmolue recalled him wholly to a sense of reality by addressing to him this question: "Come, now, master, when will you come to aid me in making gold? I am impatient to succeed."</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> shook his head, with a bitter smile. "Master Jacques read Michel <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Psellos" property="schema:name">Psellus</span>' '<i>Dialogus de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/S.P._Korolev_Rocket_and_Space_Corporation_Energia" property="schema:name">Energia</span> et Operatione Daemonum</i>.' What we are doing is not wholly innocent."</p>
<p>"Speak lower, master! I have my suspicions of it," said Jacques Charmolue. "But one must practise a bit of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermeticism" property="schema:name">hermetic</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span> when one is only <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Procurator_(Roman)" property="schema:name">procurator</span> of the king in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ecclesiastical_court" property="schema:name">ecclesiastical court</span>, at thirty crowns tournois a year. Only speak low."</p>
<p>At that moment the sound of jaws in the act of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mastication" property="schema:name">mastication</span>, which proceeded from beneath the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blast_furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span>, struck Charmolue's uneasy ear.</p>
<p>"What's that?" he inquired.</p>
<p>It was the scholar, who, ill at ease, and greatly bored in his hiding-place, had succeeded in discovering there a stale <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bread" property="schema:name">crust</span> and a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triangle" property="schema:name">triangle</span> of mouldy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cheese" property="schema:name">cheese</span>, and had set to devouring the whole without ceremony, by way of consolation and breakfast. As he was very hungry, he made a great deal of noise, and he <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atlantic_Coast_Conference" property="schema:name">acc</span>ented each mouthful strongly, which startled and alarmed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Procurator_(Roman)" property="schema:name">procurator</span>.</p>
<p>"'Tis a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" property="schema:name">cat</span> of mine," said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, quickly, "who is regaling herself under there with a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouse" property="schema:name">mouse</span>."</p>
<p>This explanation satisfied Charmolue.</p>
<p>"In fact, master," he replied, with a respectful smile, "all great philosophers have their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Familiar_spirit" property="schema:name">familiar animal</span>. You know what <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maurus_Servius_Honoratus" property="schema:name">Servius</span> saith: '<i>Nullus enim <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Locus_(genetics)" property="schema:name">locus</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sine" property="schema:name">sine</span> genio est</i>,—for there is no place that hath not its spirit.'"</p>
<p>But Dom Claude, who stood in terror of some new freak on the part of Jehan, reminded his worthy disciple that they had some figures on the façade to study together, and the two quitted the cell, to the accompaniment of a great "ouf!" from the scholar, who began to seriously fear that his knee would acquire the imprint of his chin.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00047">CHAPTER VI. THE EFFECT WHICH SEVEN OATHS IN THE OPEN AIR CAN PRODUCE.</h2>
<p>"<i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Te_Deum" property="schema:name">Te Deum Laudamus</span></i>!" exclaimed Master Jehan, creeping out from his hole, "the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Screech_owl" property="schema:name">screech-owls</span> have departed. Och! och! Hax! pax! max! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flea" property="schema:name">fleas</span>! mad dogs! the devil! I have had enough of their conversation! My head is humming like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell tower</span>. And mouldy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cheese" property="schema:name">cheese</span> to boot! Come on! Let us descend, take the big brother's purse and convert all these coins into bottles!"</p>
<p>He cast a glance of tenderness and admiration into the interior of the precious pouch, readjusted his toilet, rubbed up his boots, dusted his poor half sleeves, all gray with ashes, whistled an air, indulged in a sportive <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glossary_of_ballet" property="schema:name">pirouette</span>, looked about to see whether there were not something more in the cell to take, gathered up here and there on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span> some <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amulet" property="schema:name">amulet</span> in glass which might serve to bestow, in the guise of a trinket, on Isabeau la Thierrye, finally pushed open the door which his brother had left unfastened, as a last indulgence, and which he, in his turn, left open as a last piece of malice, and descended the circular staircase, skipping like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">bird</span>.</p>
<p>In the midst of the gloom of the spiral staircase, he elbowed something which drew aside with a growl; he took it for granted that it was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, and it struck him as so droll that he descended the remainder of the staircase holding his sides with laughter. On emerging upon the Place, he laughed yet more heartily.</p>
<p>He stamped his foot when he found himself on the ground once again. "Oh!" said he, "good and honorable pavement of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, cursed staircase, fit to put the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angel" property="schema:name">angels</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacob" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Jacob</span>'s ladder out of breath! What was I thinking of to thrust myself into that stone gimlet which pierces the sky; all for the sake of eating bearded <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cheese" property="schema:name">cheese</span>, and looking at the bell-towers of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> through a hole in the wall!"</p>
<p>He advanced a few paces, and caught sight of the two screech owls, that is to say, Dom Claude and Master Jacques Charmolue, absorbed in contemplation before a carving on the façade. He approached them on tiptoe, and heard the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> say in a low tone to Charmolue: "'Twas Guillaume de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> who caused a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book_of_Job" property="schema:name">Job</span> to be carved upon this stone of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hue" property="schema:name">hue</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lapis_lazuli" property="schema:name">lapis-lazuli</span>, gilded on the edges. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book_of_Job" property="schema:name">Job</span> represents the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span>'s stone, which must also be tried and martyrized in order to become perfect, as saith Raymond Lulle: <i>Sub conservatione formoe speciftoe salva anima</i>."</p>
<p>"That makes no difference to me," said Jehan, "'tis I who have the purse."</p>
<p>At that moment he heard a powerful and sonorous voice articulate behind him a formidable series of oaths. "<i>Sang Dieu! Ventre-.Dieu! Bédieu! Corps de Dieu! Nombril de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beelzebub" property="schema:name">Belzebuth</span>! Nom d'un pape! Come et <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">tonnerre</span></i>."</p>
<p>"Upon my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>!" exclaimed Jehan, "that can only be my friend, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_Phoebus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Captain Phoebus</span>!"</p>
<p>This name of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> reached the ears of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> at the moment when he was explaining to the king's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Procurator_(Roman)" property="schema:name">procurator</span> the dragon which is hiding its tail in a bath, from which issue smoke and the head of a king. Dom Claude started, interrupted himself and, to the great amazement of Charmolue, turned round and beheld his brother Jehan accosting a tall officer at the door of the Gondelaurier mansion.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_Phoebus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Captain Phoebus</span> de Châteaupers. He was backed up against a corner of the house of his betrothed and swearing like a heathen.</p>
<p>"By my faith! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_Phoebus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Captain Phoebus</span>," said Jehan, taking him by the hand, "you are cursing with admirable vigor."</p>
<p>"Horns and thunder!" replied the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>.</p>
<p>"Horns and thunder yourself!" replied the student. "Come now, fair <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>, whence comes this overflow of fine words?"</p>
<p>"Pardon me, good comrade Jehan," exclaimed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, shaking his hand, "a horse going at a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse_gait" property="schema:name">gallop</span> cannot halt short. Now, I was swearing at a hard <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse_gait" property="schema:name">gallop</span>. I have just been with those prudes, and when I come forth, I always find my throat full of curses, I must <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saliva" property="schema:name">spit</span> them out or strangle, <i>ventre et <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">tonnerre</span></i>!"</p>
<p>"Will you come and drink?" asked the scholar.</p>
<p>This proposition calmed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>.</p>
<p>"I'm willing, but I have no money."</p>
<p>"But I have!"</p>
<p>"Bah! let's see it!"</p>
<p>Jehan spread out the purse before the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>'s eyes, with dignity and simplicity. Meanwhile, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, who had abandoned the dumbfounded Charmolue where he stood, had approached them and halted a few paces distant, watching them without their noticing him, so deeply were they absorbed in contemplation of the purse.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> exclaimed: "A purse in your pocket, Jehan! 'tis the moon in a bucket of water, one sees it there but 'tis not there. There is nothing but its shadow. Pardieu! let us wager that these are pebbles!"</p>
<p>Jehan replied coldly: "Here are the pebbles wherewith I pave my fob!"</p>
<p>And without adding another word, he emptied the purse on a neighboring post, with the air of a Roman saving his country.</p>
<p>"True <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>!" muttered <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, "targes, big-blanks, little blanks, mailles,* every two worth one of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tournai" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Tournay</span>, farthings of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, real <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eagle" property="schema:name">eagle</span> liards! 'Tis dazzling!"</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  An ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copper" property="schema:name">copper</span> coin, the forty-fourth part of a sou or<br/>the twelfth part of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Farthing_(British_coin)" property="schema:name">farthing</span>.<br/></div>
<p>Jehan remained dignified and immovable. Several liards had rolled into the mud; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> in his enthusiasm stooped to pick them up. Jehan restrained him.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trans_World_Entertainment" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">Fye</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_Phoebus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Captain Phoebus</span> de Châteaupers!"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> counted the coins, and turning towards Jehan with solemnity, "Do you know, Jehan, that there are three and twenty sous parisis! whom have you plundered to-night, in the Street Cut-Weazand?"</p>
<p>Jehan flung back his blonde and curly head, and said, half-closing his eyes disdainfully,—</p>
<p>"We have a brother who is an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> and a fool."</p>
<p>"<i>Corne de Dieu</i>!" exclaimed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, "the worthy man!"</p>
<p>"Let us go and drink," said Jehan.</p>
<p>"Where shall we go?" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>; "'To Eve's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apple" property="schema:name">Apple</span>.'"</p>
<p>"No, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>, to 'Ancient Science.' An old woman sawing a basket handle*; 'tis a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rebus" property="schema:name">rebus</span>, and I like that."</p>

<p>"Well! here goes for Eve and her apple," said the student, and taking <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>'s arm. "By the way, my dear <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>, you just mentioned the Rue Coupe-Gueule* That is a very bad form of speech; people are no longer so barbarous. They say, Coupe-Gorge**."</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  Cut-Weazand Street.<br/><br/>     ** Cut-Throat Street.<br/></div>
<p>The two friends set out towards "Eve's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apple" property="schema:name">Apple</span>." It is unnecessary to mention that they had first gathered up the money, and that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> followed them.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> followed them, gloomy and haggard. Was this the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> whose accursed name had been mingled with all his thoughts ever since his interview with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>? He did not know it, but it was at least a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, and that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(illusion)" property="schema:name">magic</span> name sufficed to make the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> follow the two heedless comrades with the stealthy tread of a wolf, listening to their words and observing their slightest gestures with anxious attention. Moreover, nothing was easier than to hear everything they said, as they talked loudly, not in the least concerned that the passers-by were taken into their confidence. They talked of duels, wenches, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span> pots, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folly" property="schema:name">folly</span>.</p>
<p>At the turning of a street, the sound of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span> reached them from a neighboring square. Dom Claude heard the officer say to the scholar,—</p>
<p>"Thunder! Let us hasten our steps!"</p>
<p>"Why, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid lest the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span> should see me."</p>
<p>"What <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span>?"</p>
<p>"The little girl with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>."</p>
<p>"La Smeralda?"</p>
<p>"That's it, Jehan. I always forget her devil of a name. Let us make haste, she will recognize me. I don't want to have that girl accost me in the street."</p>
<p>"Do you know her, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>?"</p>
<p>Here the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> saw <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> sneer, bend down to Jehan's ear, and say a few words to him in a low voice; then <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> burst into a laugh, and shook his head with a triumphant air.</p>
<p>"Truly?" said Jehan.</p>
<p>"Upon my soul!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>.</p>
<p>"This evening?"</p>
<p>"This evening."</p>
<p>"Are you sure that she will come?"</p>
<p>"Are you a fool, Jehan? Does one doubt such things?"</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_Phoebus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Captain Phoebus</span>, you are a happy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gendarmerie" property="schema:name">gendarme</span>!"</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> heard the whole of this conversation. His teeth chattered; a visible shiver ran through his whole body. He halted for a moment, leaned against a post like a drunken man, then followed the two merry knaves.</p>
<p>At the moment when he overtook them once more, they had changed their conversation. He heard them singing at the top of their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lung" property="schema:name">lungs</span> the ancient refrain,—</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00048">CHAPTER VII. THE MYSTERIOUS MONK.</h2>
<p>The illustrious <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span> shop of "Eve's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apple" property="schema:name">Apple</span>" was situated in the University, at the corner of the Rue de la Rondelle and the Rue de la Bâtonnier. It was a very spacious and very low <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hail" property="schema:name">hail</span> on the ground floor, with a vaulted ceiling whose central spring rested upon a huge pillar of wood painted yellow; tables everywhere, shining <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pewter" property="schema:name">pewter</span> jugs hanging on the walls, always a large number of drinkers, a plenty of wenches, a window on the street, a vine at the door, and over the door a flaring piece of sheet-iron, painted with an apple and a woman, rusted by the rain and turning with the wind on an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cast_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> pin. This <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Species" property="schema:name">species</span> of weather-vane which looked upon the pavement was the signboard.</p>
<p>Night was falling; the square was dark; the wine-shop, full of candles, flamed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afar_people" property="schema:name">afar</span> like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hearth" property="schema:name">forge</span> in the gloom; the noise of glasses and feasting, of oaths and quarrels, which escaped through the broken panes, was audible. Through the mist which the warmth of the room spread over the window in front, a hundred confused figures could be seen swarming, and from time to time a burst of noisy laughter broke forth from it. The passers-by who were going about their business, slipped past this tumultuous window without glancing at it. Only at intervals did some little ragged boy raise himself on tiptoe as far as the ledge, and hurl into the drinking-shop, that ancient, jeering <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoot_(film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">hoot</span>, with which drunken men were then pursued: "Aux Houls, saouls, saouls, saouls!"</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one man paced imperturbably back and forth in front of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tavern" property="schema:name">tavern</span>, gazing at it incessantly, and going no further from it than a pikernan from his sentry-box. He was enveloped in a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantle_(mollusc)" property="schema:name">mantle</span> to his very nose. This <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantle_(mollusc)" property="schema:name">mantle</span> he had just purchased of the old-clothes man, in the vicinity of the "Eve's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apple_Inc." typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">Apple</span>," no doubt to protect himself from the cold of the March evening, possibly also, to conceal his costume. From time to time he paused in front of the dim window with its leaden <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latticework" property="schema:name">lattice</span>, listened, looked, and stamped his foot.</p>
<p>At length the door of the dram-shop opened. This was what he appeared to be waiting for. Two boon companions came forth. The ray of light which escaped from the door crimsoned for a moment their jovial faces.</p>
<p>The man in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantle_(mollusc)" property="schema:name">mantle</span> went and stationed himself on the watch under a porch on the other side of the street.</p>
<p>"<i>Corne et <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">tonnerre</span></i>!" said one of the comrades. "Seven o'clock is on the point of striking. 'Tis the hour of my appointed meeting."</p>
<p>"I tell you," repeated his companion, with a thick tongue, "that I don't live in the Rue des Mauvaises Paroles, <i>indignus qui inter mala verba <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Habitat" property="schema:name">habitat</span></i>. I have a lodging in the Rue Jean-Pain-Mollet, <i>in vico Johannis Pain-Mollet</i>.

Every one knows that he who once mounts astride a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bear" property="schema:name">bear</span> is never after afraid; but you have a nose turned to dainties like Saint-Jacques of the hospital."</p>
<p>"Jehan, my friend, you are drunk," said the other.</p>
<p>The other replied staggering, "It pleases you to say so, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>; but it hath been proved that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Plato</span> had the profile of a hound."</p>
<p>The reader has, no doubt, already recognized our two brave friends, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> and the scholar. It appears that the man who was lying in wait for them had also recognized them, for he slowly followed all the zigzags that the scholar caused the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> to make, who being a more hardened drinker had retained all his self-possession. By listening to them attentively, the man in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantle_(mollusc)" property="schema:name">mantle</span> could catch in its entirety the following interesting conversation,—</p>
<p>"<i>Corbacque</i>! Do try to walk straight, master bachelor; you know that I must leave you. Here it is seven o'clock. I have an appointment with a woman."</p>
<p>"Leave me then! I see stars and lances of fire. You are like the Chateau de Dampmartin, which is bursting with laughter."</p>
<p>"By the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wart" property="schema:name">warts</span> of my grandmother, Jehan, you are raving with too much rabidness. By the way, Jehan, have you any money left?"</p>
<p>"Monsieur <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rector_(academia)" property="schema:name">Rector</span>, there is no mistake; the little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Butcher" property="schema:name">butcher</span>'s shop, <i>parva boucheria</i>."</p>
<p>"Jehau! my friend Jehan! You know that I made an appointment with that little girl at the end of the Pont Saint-Michel, and I can only take her to the Falourdel's, the old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hag" property="schema:name">crone</span> of the bridge, and that I must pay for a chamber. The old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witch</span> with a white moustache would not <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trust_law" property="schema:name">trust</span> me. Jehan! for pity's sake! Have we drunk up the whole of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Curate" property="schema:name">curé</span>'s purse? Have you not a single parisis left?"</p>
<p>"The consciousness of having spent the other hours well is a just and savory <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Condiment" property="schema:name">condiment</span> for the table."</p>
<p>"Belly and guts! a truce to your whimsical nonsense! Tell me, Jehan of the devil! have you any money left? Give it to me, <i>bédieu</i>! or I will search you, were you as <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leprosy" property="schema:name">leprous</span> as <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book_of_Job" property="schema:name">Job</span>, and as scabby as <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julius_Caesar" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Caesar</span>!"</p>
<p>"Monsieur, the Rue Galiache is a street which hath at one end the Rue de la Verrerie, and at the other the Rue de la Tixeranderie."</p>
<p>"Well, yes! my good friend Jehan, my poor comrade, the Rue Galiache is good, very good. But in the name of heaven collect your wits. I must have a sou parisis, and the appointment is for seven o'clock."</p>
<p>"Silence for the rondo, and attention to the refrain,—</p>

<p>"Well, scholar of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antichrist" property="schema:name">Antichrist</span>, may you be strangled with the entrails of your mother!" exclaimed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, and he gave the drunken scholar a rough push; the latter slipped against the wall, and slid flabbily to the pavement of Philip <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Augustus</span>. A remnant of fraternal pity, which never abandons the heart of a drinker, prompted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> to roll Jehan with his foot upon one of those pillows of the poor, which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Providence,_Rhode_Island" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Providence</span> keeps in readiness at the corner of all the street posts of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, and which the rich blight with the name of "a rubbish-heap." The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span> adjusted Jehan's head upon an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inclined_plane" property="schema:name">inclined plane</span> of cabbage-stumps, and on the very instant, the scholar fell to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Snoring" property="schema:name">snoring</span> in a magnificent bass. Meanwhile, all malice was not extinguished in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>'s heart. "So much the worse if the devil's cart picks you up on its passage!" he said to the poor, sleeping clerk; and he strode off.</p>
<p>The man in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantle_(geology)" property="schema:name">mantle</span>, who had not ceased to follow him, halted for a moment before the prostrate scholar, as though agitated by indecision; then, uttering a profound sigh, he also strode off in pursuit of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>.</p>
<p>We, like them, will leave Jehan to slumber beneath the open sky, and will follow them also, if it pleases the reader.</p>
<p>On emerging into the Rue Saint-André-des-Arcs, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_Phoebus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Captain Phoebus</span> perceived that some one was following him. On glancing sideways by chance, he perceived a sort of shadow crawling after him along the walls. He halted, it halted; he resumed his march, it resumed its march. This disturbed him not overmuch. "Ah, bah!" he said to himself, "I have not a sou."</p>
<p>He paused in front of the College d'Autun. It was at this college that he had sketched out what he called his studies, and, through a scholar's teasing habit which still lingered in him, he never passed the façade without inflicting on the statue of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">Cardinal</span> Pierre Bertrand, sculptured to the right of the portal, the affront of which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Priapus" property="schema:name">Priapus</span> complains so bitterly in the satire of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Horace</span>, <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aliyah" property="schema:name">Olim</span> truncus eram ficulnus</i>. He had done this with so much unrelenting animosity that the inscription, <i>Eduensis episcopus</i>, had become almost effaced. Therefore, he halted before the statue according to his wont. The street was utterly deserted. At the moment when he was coolly retying his shoulder knots, with his nose in the air, he saw the shadow approaching him with slow steps, so slow that he had ample time to observe that this shadow wore a cloak and a hat. On arriving near him, it halted and remained more motionless than the statue of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">Cardinal</span> Bertrand. Meanwhile, it riveted upon <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> two intent eyes, full of that vague light which issues in the night time from the pupils of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" property="schema:name">cat</span>.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span> was brave, and would have cared very little for a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Highwayman" property="schema:name">highwayman</span>, with a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rapier" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">rapier</span> in his hand. But this walking statue, this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petrifaction" property="schema:name">petrified</span> man, froze his blood. There were then in circulation, strange stories of a surly monk, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nocturnality" property="schema:name">nocturnal</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prowler_(comics)" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">prowler</span> about the streets of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, and they recurred confusedly to his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span>. He remained for several minutes in stupefaction, and finally broke the silence with a forced laugh.</p>
<p>"Monsieur, if you are a robber, as I hope you are, you produce upon me the effect of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heron" property="schema:name">heron</span> attacking a nutshell. I am the son of a ruined family, my dear fellow. Try your hand near by here. In the chapel of this college there is some wood of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/True_Cross" property="schema:name">true cross</span> set in silver."</p>
<p>The hand of the shadow emerged from beneath its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantle_(vesture)" property="schema:name">mantle</span> and descended upon the arm of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> with the grip of an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eagle" property="schema:name">eagle</span>'s talon; at the same time the shadow spoke,—</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_Phoebus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Captain Phoebus</span> de Châteaupers!"</p>
<p>"What, the devil!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, "you know my name!"</p>
<p>"I know not your name alone," continued the man in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantle_(vesture)" property="schema:name">mantle</span>, with his sepulchral voice. "You have a rendezvous this evening."</p>
<p>"Yes," replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> in amazement.</p>
<p>"At seven o'clock."</p>
<p>"In a quarter of an hour."</p>
<p>"At la Falourdel's."</p>
<p>"Precisely."</p>
<p>"The lewd <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hag" property="schema:name">hag</span> of the Pont Saint-Michel."</p>
<p>"Of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_(archangel)" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint Michel</span> the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archangel" property="schema:name">archangel</span>, as the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord's_Prayer" property="schema:name">Pater Noster</span> saith."</p>
<p>"Impious wretch!" muttered the spectre. "With a woman?"</p>
<p>"<i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Confiteor" property="schema:name">Confiteor</span></i>,—<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Confess_(film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">I confess</span>—."</p>
<p>"Who is called—?"</p>
<p>"La Smeralda," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, gayly. All his heedlessness had gradually returned.</p>
<p>At this name, the shadow's grasp shook the arm of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> in a fury.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_Phoebus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Captain Phoebus</span> de Châteaupers, thou liest!"</p>
<p>Any one who could have beheld at that moment the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>'s inflamed countenance, his leap backwards, so violent that he disengaged himself from the grip which held him, the proud air with which he clapped his hand on his swordhilt, and, in the presence of this wrath the gloomy immobility of the man in the cloak,—any one who could have beheld this would have been frightened. There was in it a touch of the combat of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Don_Juan" property="schema:name">Don Juan</span> and the statue.</p>
<p>"Christ and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satan" property="schema:name">Satan</span>!" exclaimed the captain. "That is a word which rarely strikes the ear of a Châteaupers! Thou wilt not dare repeat it."</p>
<p>"Thou liest!" said the shadow coldly.</p>
<p>The captain gnashed his teeth. Surly monk, phantom, superstitions,—he had forgotten all at that moment. He no longer beheld anything but a man, and an insult.</p>
<p>"Ah! this is well!" he stammered, in a voice stifled with rage. He drew his sword, then stammering, for anger as well as fear makes a man tremble: "Here! On the spot! Come on! Swords! Swords! Blood on the pavement!"</p>
<p>But the other never stirred. When he beheld his adversary on guard and ready to parry,—</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_Phoebus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Captain Phoebus</span>," he said, and his tone vibrated with bitterness, "you forget your appointment."</p>
<p>The rages of men like <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> are milk-soups, whose <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boiling" property="schema:name">ebullition</span> is calmed by a drop of cold water. This simple remark caused the sword which glittered in the captain's hand to be lowered.</p>
<p>"Captain," pursued the man, "to-morrow, the day after to-morrow, a month hence, ten years hence, you will find me ready to cut your throat; but go first to your rendezvous."</p>
<p>"In sooth," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, as though seeking to capitulate with himself, "these are two charming things to be encountered in a rendezvous,—a sword and a wench; but I do not see why I should miss the one for the sake of the other, when I can have both."</p>
<p>He replaced his sword in its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scabbard" property="schema:name">scabbard</span>.</p>
<p>"Go to your rendezvous," said the man.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> with some embarrassment, "many thanks for your courtesy. In fact, there will be ample time to-morrow for us to chop up father <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adam_and_Eve" property="schema:name">Adam</span>'s <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doublet_(clothing)" property="schema:name">doublet</span> into slashes and buttonholes. I am obliged to you for allowing me to pass one more agreeable quarter of an hour. I certainly did hope to put you in the gutter, and still arrive in time for the fair one, especially as it has a better appearance to make the women wait a little in such cases. But you strike me as having the air of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallant_Man" property="schema:name">gallant man</span>, and it is safer to defer our affair until to-morrow. So I will betake myself to my rendezvous; it is for seven o'clock, as you know." Here <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> scratched his ear. "Ah. <i>Corne Dieu</i>! I had forgotten! I haven't a sou to discharge the price of the garret, and the old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hag" property="schema:name">crone</span> will insist on being paid in advance. She distrusts me."</p>
<p>"Here is the wherewithal to pay."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> felt the stranger's cold hand slip into his a large piece of money. He could not refrain from taking the money and pressing the hand.</p>
<p>"<i>Vrai Dieu</i>!" he exclaimed, "you are a good fellow!"</p>
<p>"One condition," said the man. "Prove to me that I have been wrong and that you were speaking the truth. Hide me in some corner whence I can see whether this woman is really the one whose name you uttered."</p>
<p>"Oh!" replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, "'tis all one to me. We will take, the Sainte-Marthe chamber; you can look at your ease from the kennel hard by."</p>
<p>"Come then," said the shadow.</p>
<p>"At your service," said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>, "I know not whether you are Messer Diavolus in person; but let us be good friends for this evening; to-morrow I will repay you all my debts, both of purse and sword."</p>
<p>They set out again at a rapid pace. At the expiration of a few minutes, the sound of the river announced to them that they were on the Pont Saint-Michel, then loaded with houses.</p>
<p>"I will first show you the way," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> to his companion, "I will then go in search of the fair one who is awaiting me near the Petit-Châtelet."</p>
<p>His companion made no reply; he had not uttered a word since they had been walking side by side. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> halted before a low door, and knocked roughly; a light made its appearance through the cracks of the door.</p>
<p>"Who is there?" cried a toothless voice.</p>
<p>"<i>Corps-Dieu! Tête-Dieu! Ventre-Dieu</i>!" replied the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>.</p>
<p>The door opened instantly, and allowed the new-corners to see an old woman and an old lamp, both of which trembled. The old woman was bent double, clad in tatters, with a shaking head, pierced with two small eyes, and coiffed with a dish clout; wrinkled everywhere, on hands and face and neck; her lips retreated under her gums, and about her mouth she had tufts of white hairs which gave her the whiskered look of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" property="schema:name">cat</span>.</p>
<p>The interior of the den was no less dilapitated than she; there were <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Limestone" property="schema:name">chalk</span> walls, blackened beams in the ceiling, a dismantled chimney-piece, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider" property="schema:name">spiders</span>' webs in all the corners, in the middle a staggering herd of tables and lame stools, a dirty child among the ashes, and at the back a staircase, or rather, a wooden ladder, which ended in a trap door in the ceiling.</p>
<p>On entering this lair, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>'s mysterious companion raised his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantle_(mollusc)" property="schema:name">mantle</span> to his very eyes. Meanwhile, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>, swearing like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saracen" property="schema:name">Saracen</span>, hastened to "make the sun shine in a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span>" as saith our admirable Régnier.</p>
<p>"The Sainte-Marthe chamber," said he.</p>
<p>The old woman addressed him as <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monsignor" property="schema:name">monseigneur</span>, and shut up the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span> in a drawer. It was the coin which the man in the black <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantle_(mollusc)" property="schema:name">mantle</span> had given to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>. While her back was turned, the bushy-headed and ragged little boy who was playing in the ashes, adroitly approached the drawer, abstracted the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span>, and put in its place a dry leaf which he had plucked from a fagot.</p>
<p>The old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hag" property="schema:name">crone</span> made a sign to the two gentlemen, as she called them, to follow her, and mounted the ladder in advance of them. On arriving at the upper story, she set her lamp on a coffer, and, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, like a frequent visitor of the house, opened a door which opened on a dark hole. "Enter here, my dear fellow," he said to his companion. The man in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantle_(mollusc)" property="schema:name">mantle</span> obeyed without a word in reply, the door closed upon him; he heard <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> bolt it, and a moment later descend the stairs again with the aged <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hag" property="schema:name">hag</span>. The light had disappeared.</p>
