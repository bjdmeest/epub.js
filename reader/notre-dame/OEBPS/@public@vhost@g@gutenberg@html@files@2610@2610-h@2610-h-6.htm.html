<h2 id="pgepubid00025">CHAPTER I. GOOD SOULS.</h2>
<p>Sixteen years previous to the epoch when this story takes place, one fine morning, on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Octave_of_Easter" property="schema:name">Quasimodo Sunday</span>, a living creature had been deposited, after mass, in the church of Notre-Dame, on the wooden bed securely fixed in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vestibule_(architecture)" property="schema:name">vestibule</span> on the left, opposite that great image of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Christopher" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint Christopher</span>, which the figure of Messire Antoine des Essarts, chevalier, carved in stone, had been gazing at on his knees since 1413, when they took it into their heads to overthrow the saint and the faithful follower. Upon this bed of wood it was customary to expose <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child_abandonment" property="schema:name">foundlings</span> for public charity. Whoever cared to take them did so. In front of the wooden bed was a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copper" property="schema:name">copper</span> basin for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alms" property="schema:name">alms</span>.</p>
<p>The sort of living being which lay upon that plank on the morning of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, in the year of the Lord, 1467, appeared to excite to a high degree, the curiosity of the numerous group which had congregated about the wooden bed. The group was formed for the most part of the fair sex. Hardly any one was there except old women.</p>
<p>In the first row, and among those who were most bent over the bed, four were noticeable, who, from their gray <i>cagoule</i>, a sort of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cassock" property="schema:name">cassock</span>, were recognizable as attached to some devout sisterhood. I do not see why history has not transmitted to posterity the names of these four discreet and venerable damsels. They were Agnes la <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herma" property="schema:name">Herme</span>, Jehanne de la Tarme, Henriette la Gaultière, Gauchère la Violette, all four widows, all four dames of the Chapel Etienne Haudry, who had quitted their house with the permission of their mistress, and in conformity with the statutes of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_d'Ailly" property="schema:name">Pierre d'Ailly</span>, in order to come and hear the sermon.</p>
<p>However, if these good Haudriettes were, for the moment, complying with the statutes of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_d'Ailly" property="schema:name">Pierre d'Ailly</span>, they certainly violated with joy those of Michel de Brache, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">Cardinal</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pisa" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Pisa</span>, which so inhumanly enjoined silence upon them.</p>
<p>"What is this, sister?" said Agnes to Gauchère, gazing at the little creature exposed, which was screaming and writhing on the wooden bed, terrified by so many glances.</p>
<p>"What is to become of us," said Jehanne, "if that is the way children are made now?"</p>
<p>"I'm not learned in the matter of children," resumed Agnes, "but it must be a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sin" property="schema:name">sin</span> to look at this one."</p>
<p>"'Tis not a child, Agnes."</p>
<p>"'Tis an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abortion" property="schema:name">abortion</span> of a monkey," remarked Gauchère.</p>
<p>"'Tis a miracle," interposed Henriette la Gaultière.</p>
<p>"Then," remarked Agnes, "it is the third since the Sunday of the <i>Loetare</i>: for, in less than a week, we had the miracle of the mocker of pilgrims divinely punished by Notre-Dame d'Aubervilliers, and that was the second miracle within a month."</p>
<p>"This pretended foundling is a real monster of abomination," resumed Jehanne.</p>
<p>"He yells loud enough to deafen a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chanter" property="schema:name">chanter</span>," continued Gauchère. "Hold your tongue, you little howler!"</p>
<p>"To think that Monsieur of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reims" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Reims</span> sent this enormity to Monsieur of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>," added la Gaultière, clasping her hands.</p>
<p>"I imagine," said Agnes la <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herma" property="schema:name">Herme</span>, "that it is a beast, an animal,—the fruit of—a Jew and a sow; something not <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian" property="schema:name">Christian</span>, in short, which ought to be thrown into the fire or into the water."</p>
<p>"I really hope," resumed la Gaultière, "that nobody will apply for it."</p>
<p>"Ah, good heavens!" exclaimed Agnes; "those poor nurses yonder in the foundling <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Psychiatric_hospital" property="schema:name">asylum</span>, which forms the lower end of the lane as you go to the river, just beside Monseigneur the bishop! what if this little monster were to be carried to them to suckle? I'd rather give suck to a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vampire" property="schema:name">vampire</span>."</p>
<p>"How innocent that poor la <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herma" property="schema:name">Herme</span> is!" resumed Jehanne; "don't you see, sister, that this little monster is at least four years old, and that he would have less appetite for your breast than for a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rotisserie" property="schema:name">turnspit</span>."</p>
<p>The "little monster" we should find it difficult ourselves to describe him otherwise, was, in fact, not a new-born child. It was a very angular and very lively little mass, imprisoned in its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linen" property="schema:name">linen</span> sack, stamped with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cipher" property="schema:name">cipher</span> of Messire Guillaume Chartier, then bishop of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, with a head projecting. That head was deformed enough; one beheld only a forest of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red_hair" property="schema:name">red</span> hair, one eye, a mouth, and teeth. The eye wept, the mouth cried, and the teeth seemed to ask only to be allowed to bite. The whole struggled in the sack, to the great consternation of the crowd, which increased and was renewed incessantly around it.</p>
<p>Dame Aloise de Gondelaurier, a rich and noble woman, who held by the hand a pretty girl about five or six years of age, and dragged a long veil about, suspended to the golden horn of her headdress, halted as she passed the wooden bed, and gazed for a moment at the wretched creature, while her charming little daughter, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> de Gondelaurier, spelled out with her tiny, pretty finger, the permanent inscription attached to the wooden bed: "Foundlings."</p>
<p>"Really," said the dame, turning away in disgust, "I thought that they only exposed children here."</p>
<p>She turned her back, throwing into the basin a silver <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florin_(Italian_coin)" property="schema:name">florin</span>, which rang among the liards, and made the poor goodwives of the chapel of Etienne Haudry open their eyes.</p>
<p>A moment later, the grave and learned Robert Mistricolle, the king's protonotary, passed, with an enormous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Missal" property="schema:name">missal</span> under one arm and his wife on the other (Damoiselle Guillemette la Mairesse), having thus by his side his two regulators,—spiritual and temporal.</p>
<p>"Foundling!" he said, after examining the object; "found, apparently, on the banks of the river <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phlegethon" property="schema:name">Phlegethon</span>."</p>
<p>"One can only see one eye," observed Damoiselle Guillemette; "there is a wart on the other."</p>
<p>"It's not a wart," returned Master Robert Mistricolle, "it is an egg which contains another demon exactly similar, who bears another little egg which contains another devil, and so on."</p>
<p>"How do you know that?" asked Guillemette la Mairesse.</p>
<p>"I know it pertinently," replied the protonotary.</p>
<p>"Monsieur le protonotare," asked Gauchère, "what do you prognosticate of this pretended foundling?"</p>
<p>"The greatest misfortunes," replied Mistricolle.</p>
<p>"Ah! good heavens!" said an old woman among the spectators, "and that besides our having had a considerable pestilence last year, and that they say that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">English</span> are going to disembark in a company at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harfleur" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Harfleur</span>."</p>
<p>"Perhaps that will prevent the queen from coming to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> in the month of September," interposed another; "trade is so bad already."</p>
<p>"My opinion is," exclaimed Jehanne de la Tarme, "that it would be better for the louts of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, if this little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(illusion)" property="schema:name">magician</span> were put to bed on a fagot than on a plank."</p>
<p>"A fine, flaming fagot," added the old woman.</p>
<p>"It would be more prudent," said Mistricolle.</p>
<p>For several minutes, a young priest had been listening to the reasoning of the Haudriettes and the sentences of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Notary" property="schema:name">notary</span>. He had a severe face, with a large brow, a profound glance. He thrust the crowd silently aside, scrutinized the "little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(illusion)" property="schema:name">magician</span>," and stretched out his hand upon him. It was high time, for all the devotees were already licking their chops over the "fine, flaming fagot."</p>
<p>"I adopt this child," said the priest.</p>
<p>He took it in his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cassock" property="schema:name">cassock</span> and carried it off. The spectators followed him with frightened glances. A moment later, he had disappeared through the "Red Door," which then led from the church to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span>.</p>
<p>When the first surprise was over, Jehanne de la Tarme bent down to the ear of la Gaultière,—</p>
<p>"I told you so, sister,—that young clerk, Monsieur <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>, is a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magician_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">sorcerer</span>."</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00026">CHAPTER II. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">CLAUDE FROLLO</span>.</h2>
<p>In fact, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> was no common person.</p>
<p>He belonged to one of those middle-class families which were called indifferently, in the impertinent language of the last century, the high <i>bourgeoise</i> or the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petty_nobility" property="schema:name">petty nobility</span>. This family had inherited from the brothers Paclet the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fee_(feudal_tenure)" property="schema:name">fief</span> of Tirechappe, which was dependent upon the Bishop of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, and whose twenty-one houses had been in the thirteenth century the object of so many suits before the official. As possessor of this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fee_(feudal_tenure)" property="schema:name">fief</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> was one of the twenty-seven <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fee_(feudal_tenure)" property="schema:name">seigneurs</span> keeping claim to a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manorialism" property="schema:name">manor</span> in fee in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> and its suburbs; and for a long time, his name was to be seen inscribed in this quality, between the Hôtel de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tancarville" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Tancarville</span>, belonging to Master François Le <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rez" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">Rez</span>, and the college of Tours, in the records deposited at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_of_Tours" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint Martin</span> des Champs.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> had been destined from infancy, by his parents, to the ecclesiastical profession. He had been taught to read in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span>; he had been trained to keep his eyes on the ground and to speak low. While still a child, his father had cloistered him in the college of Torchi in the University. There it was that he had grown up, on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Missal" property="schema:name">missal</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lexicon" property="schema:name">lexicon</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, he was a sad, grave, serious child, who studied ardently, and learned quickly; he never uttered a loud cry in recreation hour, mixed but little in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bacchanalia" property="schema:name">bacchanals</span> of the Rue du Fouarre, did not know what it was to <i>dare alapas et capillos laniare</i>, and had cut no figure in that revolt of 1463, which the annalists register gravely, under the title of "The sixth trouble of the University." He seldom rallied the poor students of Montaigu on the <i>cappettes</i> from which they derived their name, or the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bursar" property="schema:name">bursars</span> of the college of Dormans on their shaved <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tonsure" property="schema:name">tonsure</span>, and their surtout parti-colored of bluish-green, blue, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violet_(color)" property="schema:name">violet</span> cloth, <i>azurini coloris et bruni</i>, as says the charter of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">Cardinal</span> des Quatre-Couronnes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he was assiduous at the great and the small schools of the Rue Saint Jean de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beauvais" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Beauvais</span>. The first pupil whom the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abbé" property="schema:name">Abbé</span> de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Peter" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint Pierre</span> de Val, at the moment of beginning his reading on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canon_law_(Catholic_Church)" property="schema:name">canon law</span>, always perceived, glued to a pillar of the school Saint-Vendregesile, opposite his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rostrum_(anatomy)" property="schema:name">rostrum</span>, was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>, armed with his horn ink-bottle, biting his pen, scribbling on his threadbare knee, and, in winter, blowing on his fingers. The first <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" property="schema:name">auditor</span> whom Messire Miles d'Isliers, doctor in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decretal" property="schema:name">decretals</span>, saw arrive every Monday morning, all <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathless_(1960_film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">breathless</span>, at the opening of the gates of the school of the Chef-Saint-Denis, was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>. Thus, at sixteen years of age, the young clerk might have held his own, in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theology" property="schema:name">mystical theology</span>, against a father of the church; in canonical <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theology" property="schema:name">theology</span>, against a father of the councils; in scholastic <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theology" property="schema:name">theology</span>, against a doctor of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Paris" typeof="schema:EducationalOrganization" property="schema:name">Sorbonne</span>.</p>
<p>Theology conquered, he had plunged into <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decretal" property="schema:name">decretals</span>. From the "Master of Sentences," he had passed to the "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capitulary" property="schema:name">Capitularies</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charlemagne</span>;" and he had devoured in succession, in his appetite for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decretal" property="schema:name">decretals</span> upon <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decretal" property="schema:name">decretals</span>, those of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theodore_of_Tarsus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Theodore</span>, Bishop of Hispalus; those of Bouchard, Bishop of Worms; those of Yves, Bishop of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chartres" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Chartres</span>; next the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decretal" property="schema:name">decretal</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decretum_Gratiani" property="schema:name">Gratian</span>, which succeeded the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capitulary" property="schema:name">capitularies</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charlemagne</span>; then the collection of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Gregory_IX" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Gregory IX</span>.; then the Epistle of <i>Superspecula</i>, of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Honorius_III" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Honorius III</span>. He rendered clear and familiar to himself that vast and tumultuous period of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Civil_law_(legal_system)" property="schema:name">civil law</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canon_law" property="schema:name">canon law</span> in conflict and at strife with each other, in the chaos of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span>,—a period which Bishop <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theodore_of_Tarsus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Theodore</span> opens in 618, and which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Gregory_VII" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Pope Gregory</span> closes in 1227.</p>
<p>Decretals digested, he flung himself upon <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medicine" property="schema:name">medicine</span>, on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liberal_arts_education" property="schema:name">liberal arts</span>. He studied the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herbalism" property="schema:name">herbs</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span> of unguents; he became an expert in fevers and in contusions, in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sprain" property="schema:name">sprains</span> and abcesses. Jacques d' Espars would have received him as a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span>; Richard Hellain, as a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgeon" property="schema:name">surgeon</span>. He also passed through all the degrees of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Licentiate" property="schema:name">licentiate</span>, master, and doctor of arts. He studied the languages, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Greek</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hebrew_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Hebrew</span>, a triple sanctuary then very little frequented. His was a veritable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fever" property="schema:name">fever</span> for acquiring and hoarding, in the matter of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span>. At the age of eighteen, he had made his way through the four faculties; it seemed to the young man that life had but one sole object: learning.</p>
<p>It was towards this epoch, that the excessive heat of the summer of 1466 caused that grand outburst of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plague_(disease)" property="schema:name">plague</span> which carried off more than forty thousand souls in the vicomty of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Paris" typeof="schema:EducationalOrganization" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, and among others, as Jean de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Champagne_(historical_province)" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Troyes</span> states, "Master Arnoul, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Astrology" property="schema:name">astrologer</span> to the king, who was a very fine man, both wise and pleasant." The rumor spread in the University that the Rue Tirechappe was especially devastated by the malady. It was there that Claude's parents resided, in the midst of their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fee_(feudal_tenure)" property="schema:name">fief</span>. The young scholar rushed in great alarm to the paternal mansion. When he entered it, he found that both father and mother had died on the preceding day. A very young brother of his, who was in swaddling clothes, was still alive and crying abandoned in his cradle. This was all that remained to Claude of his family; the young man took the child under his arm and went off in a pensive mood. Up to that moment, he had lived only in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span>; he now began to live in life.</p>
<p>This catastrophe was a crisis in Claude's existence. Orphaned, the eldest, head of the family at the age of nineteen, he felt himself rudely recalled from the reveries of school to the realities of this world. Then, moved with pity, he was seized with passion and devotion towards that child, his brother; a sweet and strange thing was a human affection to him, who had hitherto loved his books alone.</p>
<p>This affection developed to a singular point; in a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> so new, it was like a first love. Separated since infancy from his parents, whom he had hardly known; cloistered and immured, as it were, in his books; eager above all things to study and to learn; exclusively attentive up to that time, to his intelligence which broadened in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span>, to his imagination, which expanded in letters,—the poor scholar had not yet had time to feel the place of his heart.</p>
<p>This young brother, without mother or father, this little child which had fallen abruptly from heaven into his arms, made a new man of him. He perceived that there was something else in the world besides the speculations of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Paris" typeof="schema:EducationalOrganization" property="schema:name">Sorbonne</span>, and the verses of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Homer</span>; that man needed affections; that life without tenderness and without love was only a set of dry, shrieking, and rending wheels. Only, he imagined, for he was at the age when illusions are as yet replaced only by illusions, that the affections of blood and family were the sole ones necessary, and that a little brother to love sufficed to fill an entire existence.</p>
<p>He threw himself, therefore, into the love for his little Jehan with the passion of a character already profound, ardent, concentrated; that poor frail creature, pretty, fair-haired, rosy, and curly,—that orphan with another orphan for his only support, touched him to the bottom of his heart; and grave thinker as he was, he set to meditating upon Jehan with an infinite compassion. He kept watch and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ward_(law)" property="schema:name">ward</span> over him as over something very fragile, and very worthy of care. He was more than a brother to the child; he became a mother to him.</p>
<p>Little Jehan had lost his mother while he was still at the breast; Claude gave him to a nurse. Besides the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fee_(feudal_tenure)" property="schema:name">fief</span> of Tirechappe, he had inherited from his father the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fee_(feudal_tenure)" property="schema:name">fief</span> of Moulin, which was a dependency of the square tower of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gentilly,_New_Orleans" property="schema:name">Gentilly</span>; it was a mill on a hill, near the château of Winchestre (<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bicêtre_Hospital" property="schema:name">Bicêtre</span>). There was a miller's wife there who was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nursing" property="schema:name">nursing</span> a fine child; it was not far from the university, and Claude carried the little Jehan to her in his own arms.</p>
<p>From that time forth, feeling that he had a burden to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bear" property="schema:name">bear</span>, he took life very seriously. The thought of his little brother became not only his recreation, but the object of his studies. He resolved to consecrate himself entirely to a future for which he was responsible in the sight of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>, and never to have any other wife, any other child than the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Happiness" property="schema:name">happiness</span> and fortune of his brother. Therefore, he attached himself more closely than ever to the clerical profession. His merits, his learning, his quality of immediate vassal of the Bishop of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, threw the doors of the church wide open to him. At the age of twenty, by special dispensation of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_See" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Holy See</span>, he was a priest, and served as the youngest of the chaplains of Notre-Dame the altar which is called, because of the late mass which is said there, <i>altare pigrorum</i>.</p>
<p>There, plunged more deeply than ever in his dear books, which he quitted only to run for an hour to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fee_(feudal_tenure)" property="schema:name">fief</span> of Moulin, this mixture of learning and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asceticism" property="schema:name">austerity</span>, so rare at his age, had promptly acquired for him the respect and admiration of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monastery" property="schema:name">monastery</span>. From the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span>, his reputation as a learned man had passed to the people, among whom it had changed a little, a frequent occurrence at that time, into reputation as a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">sorcerer</span>.</p>
<p>It was at the moment when he was returning, on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> day, from saying his mass at the Altar of the Lazy, which was by the side of the door leading to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nave" property="schema:name">nave</span> on the right, near the image of the Virgin, that his attention had been attracted by the group of old women chattering around the bed for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child_abandonment" property="schema:name">foundlings</span>.</p>
<p>Then it was that he approached the unhappy little creature, which was so hated and so menaced. That distress, that deformity, that abandonment, the thought of his young brother, the idea which suddenly occurred to him, that if he were to die, his dear little Jehan might also be flung miserably on the plank for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child_abandonment" property="schema:name">foundlings</span>,—all this had gone to his heart simultaneously; a great pity had moved in him, and he had carried off the child.</p>
<p>When he removed the child from the sack, he found it greatly deformed, in very sooth. The poor little wretch had a wart on his left eye, his head placed directly on his shoulders, his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vertebral_column" property="schema:name">spinal column</span> was crooked, his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_sternum" property="schema:name">breast bone</span> prominent, and his legs bowed; but he appeared to be lively; and although it was impossible to say in what language he lisped, his cry indicated considerable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span> and health. Claude's compassion increased at the sight of this ugliness; and he made a vow in his heart to rear the child for the love of his brother, in order that, whatever might be the future faults of the little Jehan, he should have beside him that charity done for his sake. It was a sort of investment of good works, which he was effecting in the name of his young brother; it was a stock of good works which he wished to amass in advance for him, in case the little rogue should some day find himself short of that coin, the only sort which is received at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/toll_road" property="schema:name">toll-bar</span> of paradise.</p>
<p>He baptized his adopted child, and gave him the name of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, either because he desired thereby to mark the day, when he had found him, or because he wished to designate by that name to what a degree the poor little creature was incomplete, and hardly sketched out. In fact, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, blind, hunchbacked, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genu_valgum" property="schema:name">knock-kneed</span>, was only an "almost."</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00027">CHAPTER III. <i>IMMANIS PECORIS CUSTOS, IMMANIOR IPSE</i>.</h2>
<p>Now, in 1482, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had grown up. He had become a few years previously the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> of Notre-Dame, thanks to his father by adoption, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>,—who had become <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> of Josas, thanks to his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suzerainty" property="schema:name">suzerain</span>, Messire Louis de Beaumont,—who had become Bishop of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, at the death of Guillaume Chartier in 1472, thanks to his patron, Olivier Le Daim, barber to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>., king by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_grace" property="schema:name">grace</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>.</p>
<p>So <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was the ringer of the chimes of Notre-Dame.</p>
<p>In the course of time there had been formed a certain peculiarly intimate bond which united the ringer to the church. Separated forever from the world, by the double fatality of his unknown birth and his natural deformity, imprisoned from his infancy in that impassable double circle, the poor wretch had grown used to seeing nothing in this world beyond the religious walls which had received him under their shadow. Notre-Dame had been to him successively, as he grew up and developed, the egg, the nest, the house, the country, the universe.</p>
<p>There was certainly a sort of mysterious and pre-existing harmony between this creature and this church. When, still a little fellow, he had dragged himself tortuously and by jerks beneath the shadows of its vaults, he seemed, with his human face and his bestial limbs, the natural <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reptile" property="schema:name">reptile</span> of that humid and sombre pavement, upon which the shadow of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque</span> capitals cast so many strange forms.</p>
<p>Later on, the first time that he caught hold, mechanically, of the ropes to the towers, and hung suspended from them, and set the bell to clanging, it produced upon his adopted father, Claude, the effect of a child whose tongue is unloosed and who begins to speak.</p>
<p>It is thus that, little by little, developing always in sympathy with the cathedral, living there, sleeping there, hardly ever leaving it, subject every hour to the mysterious impress, he came to resemble it, he incrusted himself in it, so to speak, and became an integral part of it. His salient angles fitted into the retreating angles of the cathedral (if we may be allowed this figure of speech), and he seemed not only its inhabitant but more than that, its natural tenant. One might almost say that he had assumed its form, as the snail takes on the form of its shell. It was his dwelling, his hole, his envelope. There existed between him and the old church so profound an instinctive sympathy, so many magnetic affinities, so many material affinities, that he adhered to it somewhat as a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tortoise" property="schema:name">tortoise</span> adheres to its shell. The rough and wrinkled cathedral was his shell.</p>
<p>It is useless to warn the reader not to take literally all the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Simile" property="schema:name">similes</span> which we are obliged to employ here to express the singular, symmetrical, direct, almost <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Consubstantiality" property="schema:name">consubstantial</span> union of a man and an edifice. It is equally unnecessary to state to what a degree that whole cathedral was familiar to him, after so long and so intimate a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cohabitation" property="schema:name">cohabitation</span>. That dwelling was peculiar to him. It had no depths to which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had not penetrated, no height which he had not scaled. He often climbed many stones up the front, aided solely by the uneven points of the carving. The towers, on whose exterior surface he was frequently seen clambering, like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lizard" property="schema:name">lizard</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Motility" property="schema:name">gliding</span> along a perpendicular wall, those two gigantic twins, so lofty, so menacing, so formidable, possessed for him neither <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vertigo" property="schema:name">vertigo</span>, nor terror, nor shocks of amazement.</p>
<p>To see them so gentle under his hand, so easy to scale, one would have said that he had tamed them. By dint of leaping, climbing, gambolling amid the abysses of the gigantic cathedral he had become, in some sort, a monkey and a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, like the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Calabria" typeof="schema:AdministrativeArea" property="schema:name">Calabrian</span> child who swims before he <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" property="schema:name">walks</span>, and plays with the sea while still a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fabergé_(cosmetics)" property="schema:name">babe</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was not his body alone which seemed fashioned after the Cathedral, but his mind also. In what condition was that mind? What bent had it contracted, what form had it assumed beneath that knotted envelope, in that savage life? This it would be hard to determine. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had been born one-eyed, hunchbacked, lame. It was with great difficulty, and by dint of great patience that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> had succeeded in teaching him to talk. But a fatality was attached to the poor foundling. Bellringer of Notre-Dame at the age of fourteen, a new infirmity had come to complete his misfortunes: the bells had broken the drums of his ears; he had become <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>. The only gate which nature had left wide open for him had been abruptly closed, and forever.</p>
<p>In closing, it had cut off the only ray of joy and of light which still made its way into the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. His <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> fell into profound night. The wretched being's misery became as incurable and as complete as his deformity. Let us add that his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deafness</span> rendered him to some extent dumb. For, in order not to make others laugh, the very moment that he found himself to be <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>, he resolved upon a silence which he only broke when he was alone. He voluntarily tied that tongue which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> had taken so much pains to unloose. Hence, it came about, that when necessity constrained him to speak, his tongue was torpid, awkward, and like a door whose hinges have grown rusty.</p>
<p>If now we were to try to penetrate to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> through that thick, hard rind; if we could sound the depths of that badly constructed organism; if it were granted to us to look with a torch behind those non-transparent organs to explore the shadowy interior of that opaque creature, to elucidate his obscure corners, his absurd no-thoroughfares, and suddenly to cast a vivid light upon the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> enchained at the extremity of that cave, we should, no doubt, find the unhappy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Psychology_of_self" property="schema:name">Psyche</span> in some poor, cramped, and ricketty attitude, like those prisoners beneath the Leads of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venice" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Venice</span>, who grew old bent double in a stone box which was both too low and too short for them.</p>
<p>It is certain that the mind becomes atrophied in a defective body. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was barely conscious of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> cast in his own image, moving blindly within him. The impressions of objects underwent a considerable refraction before reaching his mind. His <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brain" property="schema:name">brain</span> was a peculiar medium; the ideas which passed through it issued forth completely distorted. The reflection which resulted from this refraction was, necessarily, divergent and perverted.</p>
<p>Hence a thousand <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Optical_illusion" property="schema:name">optical illusions</span>, a thousand <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Optical_aberration" property="schema:name">aberrations</span> of judgment, a thousand deviations, in which his thought strayed, now mad, now idiotic.</p>
<p>The first effect of this fatal organization was to trouble the glance which he cast upon things. He received hardly any immediate perception of them. The external world seemed much farther away to him than it does to us.</p>
<p>The second effect of his misfortune was to render him malicious.</p>
<p>He was malicious, in fact, because he was savage; he was savage because he was ugly. There was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Logic" property="schema:name">logic</span> in his nature, as there is in ours.</p>
<p>His strength, so extraordinarily developed, was a cause of still greater malevolence: "<i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apple" property="schema:name">Malus</span> puer robustus</i>," says Hobbes.</p>
<p>This justice must, however be rendered to him. Malevolence was not, perhaps, innate in him. From his very first steps among men, he had felt himself, later on he had seen himself, spewed out, blasted, rejected. Human words were, for him, always a raillery or a malediction. As he grew up, he had found nothing but hatred around him. He had caught the general malevolence. He had picked up the weapon with which he had been wounded.</p>
<p>After all, he turned his face towards men only with reluctance; his cathedral was sufficient for him. It was peopled with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> figures,—kings, saints, bishops,—who at least did not burst out laughing in his face, and who gazed upon him only with tranquillity and kindliness. The other statues, those of the monsters and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demon" property="schema:name">demons</span>, cherished no hatred for him, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. He resembled them too much for that. They seemed rather, to be scoffing at other men. The saints were his friends, and blessed him; the monsters were his friends and guarded him. So he held long <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eucharist" property="schema:name">communion</span> with them. He sometimes passed whole hours crouching before one of these statues, in solitary conversation with it. If any one came, he fled like a lover surprised in his serenade.</p>
<p>And the cathedral was not only society for him, but the universe, and all nature beside. He dreamed of no other hedgerows than the painted windows, always in flower; no other shade than that of the foliage of stone which spread out, loaded with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">birds</span>, in the tufts of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anglo-Saxons" property="schema:name">Saxon</span> capitals; of no other mountains than the colossal towers of the church; of no other ocean than <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, roaring at their bases.</p>
<p>What he loved above all else in the maternal edifice, that which aroused his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, and made it open its poor wings, which it kept so miserably folded in its cavern, that which sometimes rendered him even happy, was the bells. He loved them, fondled them, talked to them, understood them. From the chime in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span>, over the intersection of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aisle" property="schema:name">aisles</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nave" property="schema:name">nave</span>, to the great bell of the front, he cherished a tenderness for them all. The central <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span> and the two towers were to him as three great cages, whose <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">birds</span>, reared by himself, sang for him alone. Yet it was these very bells which had made him <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>; but mothers often love best that child which has caused them the most suffering.</p>
<p>It is true that their voice was the only one which he could still hear. On this score, the big bell was his beloved. It was she whom he preferred out of all that family of noisy girls which bustled above him, on festival days. This bell was named Marie. She was alone in the southern tower, with her sister Jacqueline, a bell of lesser size, shut up in a smaller cage beside hers. This Jacqueline was so called from the name of the wife of Jean Montagu, who had given it to the church, which had not prevented his going and figuring without his head at Montfauçon. In the second tower there were six other bells, and, finally, six smaller ones inhabited the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">belfry</span> over the crossing, with the wooden bell, which rang only between after dinner on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Good_Friday" property="schema:name">Good Friday</span> and the morning of the day before <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Easter" property="schema:name">Easter</span>. So <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had fifteen bells in his seraglio; but big Marie was his favorite.</p>
<p>No idea can be formed of his delight on days when the grand <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">peal</span> was sounded. At the moment when the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> dismissed him, and said, "Go!" he mounted the spiral staircase of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clock_tower" property="schema:name">clock tower</span> faster than any one else could have descended it. He entered perfectly <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathless_(1960_film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">breathless</span> into the aerial chamber of the great bell; he gazed at her a moment, devoutly and lovingly; then he gently addressed her and patted her with his hand, like a good horse, which is about to set out on a long journey. He pitied her for the trouble that she was about to suffer. After these first caresses, he shouted to his assistants, placed in the lower story of the tower, to begin. They grasped the ropes, the wheel creaked, the enormous capsule of metal started slowly into motion. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> followed it with his glance and trembled. The first shock of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_(instrument)" property="schema:name">clapper</span> and the brazen wall made the framework upon which it was mounted quiver. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> vibrated with the bell.</p>
<p>"Vah!" he cried, with a senseless burst of laughter. However, the movement of the bass was accelerated, and, in proportion as it described a wider angle, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>'s eye opened also more and more widely, phosphoric and flaming. At length the grand <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">peal</span> began; the whole tower trembled; woodwork, leads, cut stones, all groaned at once, from the piles of the foundation to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trefoil" property="schema:name">trefoils</span> of its summit. Then <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> boiled and frothed; he went and came; he trembled from head to foot with the tower. The bell, furious, running riot, presented to the two walls of the tower alternately its brazen throat, whence escaped that tempestuous breath, which is audible leagues away. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> stationed himself in front of this open throat; he crouched and rose with the oscillations of the bell, breathed in this overwhelming breath, gazed by turns at the deep place, which swarmed with people, two hundred feet below him, and at that enormous, brazen tongue which came, second after second, to howl in his ear.</p>
<p>It was the only speech which he understood, the only sound which broke for him the universal silence. He swelled out in it as a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">bird</span> does in the sun. All of a sudden, the frenzy of the bell seized upon him; his look became extraordinary; he lay in wait for the great bell as it passed, as a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider" property="schema:name">spider</span> lies in wait for a fly, and flung himself abruptly upon it, with might and main. Then, suspended above the abyss, borne to and fro by the formidable swinging of the bell, he seized the brazen monster by the ear-laps, pressed it between both knees, spurred it on with his heels, and redoubled the fury of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ring_of_bells" property="schema:name">peal</span> with the whole shock and weight of his body. Meanwhile, the tower trembled; he shrieked and gnashed his teeth, his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> hair rose erect, his breast heaving like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bellows" property="schema:name">bellows</span>, his eye flashed flames, the monstrous bell neighed, panting, beneath him; and then it was no longer the great bell of Notre-Dame nor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>: it was a dream, a whirlwind, a tempest, dizziness mounted astride of noise; a spirit clinging to a flying <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crupper" property="schema:name">crupper</span>, a strange <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Centaur" property="schema:name">centaur</span>, half man, half bell; a sort of horrible Astolphus, borne away upon a prodigious <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippogriff" property="schema:name">hippogriff</span> of living bronze.</p>
<p>The presence of this extraordinary being caused, as it were, a breath of life to circulate throughout the entire cathedral. It seemed as though there escaped from him, at least according to the growing superstitions of the crowd, a mysterious emanation which animated all the stones of Notre-Dame, and made the deep bowels of the ancient church to palpitate. It sufficed for people to know that he was there, to make them believe that they beheld the thousand statues of the galleries and the fronts in motion. And the cathedral did indeed seem a docile and obedient creature beneath his hand; it waited on his will to raise its great voice; it was possessed and filled with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, as with a familiar spirit. One would have said that he made the immense edifice breathe. He was everywhere about it; in fact, he multiplied himself on all points of the structure. Now one perceived with affright at the very top of one of the towers, a fantastic <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dwarf_(Germanic_mythology)" property="schema:name">dwarf</span> climbing, writhing, crawling on all fours, descending outside above the abyss, leaping from projection to projection, and going to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Looting" property="schema:name">ransack</span> the belly of some sculptured <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gorgon" property="schema:name">gorgon</span>; it was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> dislodging the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crow" property="schema:name">crows</span>. Again, in some obscure corner of the church one came in contact with a sort of living <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chimera_(mythology)" property="schema:name">chimera</span>, crouching and scowling; it was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> engaged in thought. Sometimes one caught sight, upon a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell tower</span>, of an enormous head and a bundle of disordered limbs swinging furiously at the end of a rope; it was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> ringing <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vespers" property="schema:name">vespers</span> or the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angel_(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer)" property="schema:name">Angelus</span>. Often at night a hideous form was seen wandering along the frail <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span> of carved <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lace" property="schema:name">lacework</span>, which crowns the towers and borders the circumference of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apse" property="schema:name">apse</span>; again it was the hunchback of Notre-Dame. Then, said the women of the neighborhood, the whole church took on something fantastic, supernatural, horrible; eyes and mouths were opened, here and there; one heard the dogs, the monsters, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gargoyle" property="schema:name">gargoyles</span> of stone, which keep watch night and day, with outstretched neck and open jaws, around the monstrous cathedral, barking. And, if it was a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christmas_Eve" property="schema:name">Christmas Eve</span>, while the great bell, which seemed to emit the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death_rattle" property="schema:name">death rattle</span>, summoned the faithful to the midnight mass, such an air was spread over the sombre façade that one would have declared that the grand portal was devouring the throng, and that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rose_window" property="schema:name">rose window</span> was watching it. And all this came from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egypt</span> would have taken him for the god of this temple; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span> believed him to be its demon: he was in fact its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>.</p>
<p>To such an extent was this disease that for those who know that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> has existed, Notre-Dame is to-day deserted, inanimate, dead. One feels that something has disappeared from it. That immense body is empty; it is a skeleton; the spirit has quitted it, one sees its place and that is all. It is like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_skull" property="schema:name">skull</span> which still has holes for the eyes, but no longer sight.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there was one human creature whom <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> excepted from his malice and from his hatred for others, and whom he loved even more, perhaps, than his cathedral: this was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>.</p>
<p>The matter was simple; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> had taken him in, had adopted him, had nourished him, had reared him. When a little lad, it was between <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>'s legs that he was accustomed to seek refuge, when the dogs and the children barked after him. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> had taught him to talk, to read, to write. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> had finally made him the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span>. Now, to give the big bell in marriage to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was to give <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romeo_and_Juliet" property="schema:name">Juliet</span> to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romeo_and_Juliet" property="schema:name">Romeo</span>.</p>
<p>Hence <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>'s gratitude was profound, passionate, boundless; and although the visage of his adopted father was often clouded or severe, although his speech was habitually curt, harsh, imperious, that gratitude never wavered for a single moment. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> had in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> the most submissive slave, the most docile lackey, the most vigilant of dogs. When the poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> became <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>, there had been established between him and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>, a language of signs, mysterious and understood by themselves alone. In this manner the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> was the sole human being with whom <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had preserved communication. He was in sympathy with but two things in this world: Notre-Dame and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>.</p>
<p>There is nothing which can be compared with the empire of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> over the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span>; with the attachment of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>. A sign from Claude and the idea of giving him pleasure would have sufficed to make <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> hurl himself headlong from the summit of Notre-Dame. It was a remarkable thing—all that physical strength which had reached in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> such an extraordinary development, and which was placed by him blindly at the disposition of another. There was in it, no doubt, filial devotion, domestic attachment; there was also the fascination of one spirit by another spirit. It was a poor, awkward, and clumsy organization, which stood with lowered head and supplicating eyes before a lofty and profound, a powerful and superior intellect. Lastly, and above all, it was gratitude. Gratitude so pushed to its extremest limit, that we do not know to what to compare it. This virtue is not one of those of which the finest examples are to be met with among men. We will say then, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> loved the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> as never a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">dog</span>, never a horse, never an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elephant" property="schema:name">elephant</span> loved his master.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00029">CHAPTER <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/V." typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">V.</span> MORE ABOUT <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">CLAUDE FROLLO</span>.</h2>
<p>In 1482, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was about twenty years of age; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>, about thirty-six. One had grown up, the other had grown old.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> was no longer the simple scholar of the college of Torch, the tender protector of a little child, the young and dreamy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span> who knew many things and was ignorant of many. He was a priest, austere, grave, morose; one charged with souls; monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> of Josas, the bishop's second acolyte, having charge of the two <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dean_(Christianity)" property="schema:name">deaneries</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montlhéry" property="schema:name">Montlhéry</span>, and Châteaufort, and one hundred and seventy-four country <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Curate" property="schema:name">curacies</span>. He was an imposing and sombre personage, before whom the choir boys in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alb" property="schema:name">alb</span> and in jacket trembled, as well as the machicots*, and the brothers of Saint-Augustine and the matutinal clerks of Notre-Dame, when he passed slowly beneath the lofty arches of the choir, majestic, thoughtful, with arms folded and his head so bent upon his breast that all one saw of his face was his large, bald brow.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  An official of Notre-Dame, lower than a beneficed clergyman,<br/>higher than simple paid chanters.<br/></div>
<p>Dom <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> had, however, abandoned neither <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span> nor the education of his young brother, those two occupations of his life. But as time went on, some bitterness had been mingled with these things which were so sweet. In the long run, says Paul Diacre, the best <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lard" property="schema:name">lard</span> turns rancid. Little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Jehan Frollo</span>, surnamed (<i>du Moulin</i>) "of the Mill" because of the place where he had been reared, had not grown up in the direction which Claude would have liked to impose upon him. The big brother counted upon a pious, docile, learned, and honorable pupil. But the little brother, like those young trees which deceive the gardener's hopes and turn obstinately to the quarter whence they receive sun and air, the little brother did not grow and did not multiply, but only put forth fine bushy and luxuriant branches on the side of laziness, ignorance, and debauchery. He was a regular devil, and a very disorderly one, who made Dom Claude scowl; but very droll and very subtle, which made the big brother smile.</p>
<p>Claude had confided him to that same college of Torchi where he had passed his early years in study and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Meditation" property="schema:name">meditation</span>; and it was a grief to him that this sanctuary, formerly edified by the name of Frollo, should to-day be scandalized by it. He sometimes preached Jehan very long and severe sermons, which the latter intrepidly endured. After all, the young scapegrace had a good heart, as can be seen in all comedies. But the sermon over, he none the less tranquilly resumed his course of seditions and enormities. Now it was a <i>bejaune</i> or yellow beak (as they called the new arrivals at the university), whom he had been mauling by way of welcome; a precious tradition which has been carefully preserved to our own day. Again, he had set in movement a band of scholars, who had flung themselves upon a wine-shop in classic fashion, quasi <i>classico excitati</i>, had then beaten the tavern-keeper "with offensive <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Club_(weapon)" property="schema:name">cudgels</span>," and joyously pillaged the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tavern" property="schema:name">tavern</span>, even to smashing in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hogshead" property="schema:name">hogsheads</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span> in the cellar. And then it was a fine report in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span>, which the sub-monitor of Torchi carried piteously to Dom Claude with this dolorous marginal comment,—<i>Rixa; prima causa vinum optimum potatum</i>. Finally, it was said, a thing quite horrible in a boy of sixteen, that his debauchery often extended as far as the Rue de Glatigny.</p>
<p>Claude, saddened and discouraged in his human affections, by all this, had flung himself eagerly into the arms of learning, that sister which, at least does not laugh in your face, and which always pays you, though in money that is sometimes a little hollow, for the attention which you have paid to her. Hence, he became more and more learned, and, at the same time, as a natural consequence, more and more rigid as a priest, more and more sad as a man. There are for each of us several parallelisms between our intelligence, our habits, and our character, which develop without a break, and break only in the great disturbances of life.</p>
<p>As <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> had passed through nearly the entire circle of human learning—positive, exterior, and permissible—since his youth, he was obliged, unless he came to a halt, <i>ubi defuit orbis</i>, to proceed further and seek other aliments for the insatiable activity of his intelligence. The antique symbol of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Snake" property="schema:name">serpent</span> biting its tail is, above all, applicable to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span>. It would appear that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> had experienced this. Many grave persons affirm that, after having exhausted the <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glossary_of_ancient_Roman_religion" property="schema:name">fas</span></i> of human learning, he had dared to penetrate into the <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glossary_of_ancient_Roman_religion" property="schema:name">nefas</span></i>. He had, they said, tasted in succession all the apples of the tree of knowledge, and, whether from hunger or disgust, had ended by tasting the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil" property="schema:name">forbidden fruit</span>. He had taken his place by turns, as the reader has seen, in the conferences of the theologians in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Paris" typeof="schema:EducationalOrganization" property="schema:name">Sorbonne</span>,—in the assemblies of the doctors of art, after the manner of Saint-Hilaire,—in the disputes of the decretalists, after the manner of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laval,_Quebec" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Martin</span>,—in the congregations of physicians at the holy water font of Notre-Dame, <i>ad cupam Nostroe-Dominoe</i>. All the dishes permitted and approved, which those four great kitchens called the four faculties could elaborate and serve to the understanding, he had devoured, and had been satiated with them before his hunger was appeased. Then he had penetrated further, lower, beneath all that finished, material, limited knowledge; he had, perhaps, risked his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, and had seated himself in the cavern at that mysterious table of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alchemy" property="schema:name">alchemists</span>, of the astrologers, of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermeticism" property="schema:name">hermetics</span>, of which Averroès, Gillaume de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Paris" typeof="schema:EducationalOrganization" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolas_Flamel" property="schema:name">Nicolas Flamel</span> hold the end in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span>; and which extends in the East, by the light of the seven-branched candlestick, to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solomon" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Solomon</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pythagoras" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Pythagoras</span>, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroaster" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Zoroaster</span>.</p>
<p>That is, at least, what was supposed, whether rightly or not. It is certain that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> often visited the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cemetery" property="schema:name">cemetery</span> of the Saints-Innocents, where, it is true, his father and mother had been buried, with other victims of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plague_(disease)" property="schema:name">plague</span> of 1466; but that he appeared far less devout before the cross of their grave than before the strange figures with which the tomb of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolas_Flamel" property="schema:name">Nicolas Flamel</span> and Claude Pernelle, erected just beside it, was loaded.</p>
<p>It is certain that he had frequently been seen to pass along the Rue des <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lombards" property="schema:name">Lombards</span>, and furtively enter a little house which formed the corner of the Rue des Ecrivans and the Rue Marivault. It was the house which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolas_Flamel" property="schema:name">Nicolas Flamel</span> had built, where he had died about 1417, and which, constantly deserted since that time, had already begun to fall in ruins,—so greatly had the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermeticism" property="schema:name">hermetics</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alchemy" property="schema:name">alchemists</span> of all countries wasted away the walls, merely by carving their names upon them. Some neighbors even affirm that they had once seen, through an air-hole, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">Archdeacon</span> Claude excavating, turning over, digging up the earth in the two cellars, whose supports had been daubed with numberless <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Couplet" property="schema:name">couplets</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egyptian_hieroglyphs" property="schema:name">hieroglyphics</span> by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolas_Flamel" property="schema:name">Nicolas Flamel</span> himself. It was supposed that Flamel had buried the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span>'s stone in the cellar; and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alchemy" property="schema:name">alchemists</span>, for the space of two centuries, from Magistri to Father Pacifique, never ceased to worry the soil until the house, so cruelly ransacked and turned over, ended by falling into dust beneath their feet.</p>
<p>Again, it is certain that the archdeacon had been seized with a singular passion for the symbolical door of Notre-Dame, that page of a conjuring book written in stone, by Bishop Guillaume de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, who has, no doubt, been damned for having affixed so infernal a frontispiece to the sacred poem chanted by the rest of the edifice. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">Archdeacon</span> Claude had the credit also of having fathomed the mystery of the colossus of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Christopher" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint Christopher</span>, and of that lofty, enigmatical statue which then stood at the entrance of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vestibule_(architecture)" property="schema:name">vestibule</span>, and which the people, in derision, called "Monsieur Legris." But, what every one might have noticed was the interminable hours which he often employed, seated upon the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parapet" property="schema:name">parapet</span> of the area in front of the church, in contemplating the sculptures of the front; examining now the foolish virgins with their lamps reversed, now the wise virgins with their lamps upright; again, calculating the angle of vision of that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raven" property="schema:name">raven</span> which belongs to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Left_Front" property="schema:name">left front</span>, and which is looking at a mysterious point inside the church, where is concealed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span>'s stone, if it be not in the cellar of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolas_Flamel" property="schema:name">Nicolas Flamel</span>.</p>
<p>It was, let us remark in passing, a singular fate for the Church of Notre-Dame at that epoch to be so beloved, in two different degrees, and with so much devotion, by two beings so dissimilar as Claude and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. Beloved by one, a sort of instinctive and savage half-man, for its beauty, for its stature, for the harmonies which emanated from its magnificent ensemble; beloved by the other, a learned and passionate imagination, for its myth, for the sense which it contains, for the symbolism scattered beneath the sculptures of its front,—like the first text underneath the second in a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palimpsest" property="schema:name">palimpsest</span>,—in a word, for the enigma which it is eternally propounding to the understanding.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is certain that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> had established himself in that one of the two towers which looks upon the Grève, just beside the frame for the bells, a very secret little cell, into which no one, not even the bishop, entered without his leave, it was said. This tiny cell had formerly been made almost at the summit of the tower, among the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raven" property="schema:name">ravens</span>' nests, by Bishop Hugo de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Besançon" property="schema:name">Besançon</span>* who had wrought <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">sorcery</span> there in his day. What that cell contained, no one knew; but from the strand of the Terrain, at night, there was often seen to appear, disappear, and reappear at brief and regular intervals, at a little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dormer" property="schema:name">dormer window</span> opening upon the back of the tower, a certain <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span>, intermittent, singular light which seemed to follow the panting breaths of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bellows" property="schema:name">bellows</span>, and to proceed from a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire" property="schema:name">flame</span>, rather than from a light. In the darkness, at that height, it produced a singular effect; and the goodwives said: "There's the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> blowing! hell is sparkling up yonder!"</p></body></html>
