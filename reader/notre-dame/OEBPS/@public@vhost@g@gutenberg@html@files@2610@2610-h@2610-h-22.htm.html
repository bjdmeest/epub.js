<body prefix="schema: http://schema.org/"><p>At that moment, the mother who was crouching on the pavement, opened her eyes wide. Without uttering a cry, she raised herself erect with a terrible expression; then she flung herself upon the hand of the executioner, like a beast on its prey, and bit it. It was done like a flash of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lightning" property="schema:name">lightning</span>. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Executioner" property="schema:name">headsman</span> howled with pain. Those near by rushed up. With difficulty they withdrew his bleeding hand from the mother's teeth. She preserved a profound silence. They thrust her back with much brutality, and noticed that her head fell heavily on the pavement. They raised her, she fell back again. She was dead.</p>
<p>The executioner, who had not loosed his hold on the young girl, began to ascend the ladder once more.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00074">CHAPTER II. THE BEAUTIFUL CREATURE CLAD IN WHITE. (Dante.)</h2>
<p>When <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> saw that the cell was empty, that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> was no longer there, that while he had been defending her she had been abducted, he grasped his hair with both hands and stamped with surprise and pain; then he set out to run through the entire church seeking his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span>, howling strange cries to all the corners of the walls, strewing his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> hair on the pavement. It was just at the moment when the king's archers were making their victorious entrance into Notre-Dame, also in search of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, poor, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> fellow, aided them in their fatal intentions, without suspecting it; he thought that the outcasts were the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s enemies. He himself conducted Tristan l'Hermite to all possible hiding-places, opened to him the secret doors, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Double_bottom" property="schema:name">double bottoms</span> of the altars, the rear sacristries. If the unfortunate girl had still been there, it would have been he himself who would have delivered her up.</p>
<p>When the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fatigue_(medical)" property="schema:name">fatigue</span> of finding nothing had disheartened <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tristan" property="schema:name">Tristan</span>, who was not easily discouraged, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> continued the search alone. He made the tour of the church twenty times, length and breadth, up and down, ascending and descending, running, calling, shouting, peeping, rummaging, ransacking, thrusting his head into every hole, pushing a torch under every vault, despairing, mad. A male who has lost his female is no more roaring nor more haggard.</p>
<p>At last when he was sure, perfectly sure that she was no longer there, that all was at an end, that she had been snatched from him, he slowly mounted the staircase to the towers, that staircase which he had ascended with so much eagerness and triumph on the day when he had saved her. He passed those same places once more with drooping head, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voicelessness" property="schema:name">voiceless</span>, tearless, almost <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathless_(1960_film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">breathless</span>. The church was again deserted, and had fallen back into its silence. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Archers" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">The archers</span> had quitted it to track the sorceress in the city. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, left alone in that vast Notre-Dame, so besieged and tumultuous but a short time before, once more betook himself to the cell where the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> had slept for so many weeks under his guardianship.</p>
<p>As he approached it, he fancied that he might, perhaps, find her there. When, at the turn of the gallery which opens on the roof of the side <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aisle" property="schema:name">aisles</span>, he perceived the tiny cell with its little window and its little door crouching beneath a great <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flying_buttress" property="schema:name">flying buttress</span> like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">bird</span>'s nest under a branch, the poor man's heart failed him, and he leaned against a pillar to keep from falling. He imagined that she might have returned thither, that some good genius had, no doubt, brought her back, that this chamber was too tranquil, too safe, too charming for her not to be there, and he dared not take another step for fear of destroying his illusion. "Yes," he said to himself, "perchance she is sleeping, or praying. I must not disturb her."</p>
<p>At length he summoned up courage, advanced on tiptoe, looked, entered. Empty. The cell was still empty. The unhappy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man walked slowly round it, lifted the bed and looked beneath it, as though she might be concealed between the pavement and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mattress" property="schema:name">mattress</span>, then he shook his head and remained <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stupefied" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">stupefied</span>. All at once, he crushed his torch under his foot, and, without uttering a word, without giving vent to a sigh, he flung himself at full speed, head foremost against the wall, and fell fainting on the floor.</p>
<p>When he recovered his senses, he threw himself on the bed and rolling about, he kissed frantically the place where the young girl had slept and which was still warm; he remained there for several moments as motionless as though he were about to expire; then he rose, dripping with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perspiration" property="schema:name">perspiration</span>, panting, mad, and began to beat his head against the wall with the frightful regularity of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_(instrument)" property="schema:name">clapper</span> of his bells, and the resolution of a man determined to kill himself. At length he fell a second time, exhausted; he dragged himself on his knees outside the cell, and crouched down facing the door, in an attitude of astonishment.</p>
<p>He remained thus for more than an hour without making a movement, with his eye fixed on the deserted cell, more gloomy, and more pensive than a mother seated between an empty cradle and a full coffin. He uttered not a word; only at long intervals, a sob heaved his body violently, but it was a tearless sob, like <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Summer_Lightning" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">summer lightning</span> which makes no noise.</p>
<p>It appears to have been then, that, seeking at the bottom of his lonely thoughts for the unexpected abductor of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, he thought of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>. He remembered that Dom Claude alone possessed a key to the staircase leading to the cell; he recalled his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nocturnality" property="schema:name">nocturnal</span> attempts on the young girl, in the first of which he, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, had assisted, the second of which he had prevented. He recalled a thousand details, and soon he no longer doubted that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> had taken the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>. Nevertheless, such was his respect for the priest, such his gratitude, his devotion, his love for this man had taken such deep root in his heart, that they resisted, even at this moment, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claw" property="schema:name">talons</span> of jealousy and despair.</p>
<p>He reflected that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> had done this thing, and the wrath of blood and death which it would have evoked in him against any other person, turned in the poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man, from the moment when <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> was in question, into an increase of grief and sorrow.</p>
<p>At the moment when his thought was thus fixed upon the priest, while the daybreak was whitening the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flying_buttress" property="schema:name">flying buttresses</span>, he perceived on the highest story of Notre-Dame, at the angle formed by the external <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span> as it makes the turn of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chancel" property="schema:name">chancel</span>, a figure walking. This figure was coming towards him. He recognized it. It was the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>.</p>
<p>Claude was walking with a slow, grave step. He did not look before him as he walked, he was directing his course towards the northern tower, but his face was turned aside towards the right <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flight_dynamics_(fixed-wing_aircraft)" property="schema:name">bank</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>, and he held his head high, as though trying to see something over the roofs. The owl often assumes this oblique attitude. It flies towards one point and looks towards another. In this manner the priest passed above <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> without seeing him.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man, who had been <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petrifaction" property="schema:name">petrified</span> by this sudden apparition, beheld him disappear through the door of the staircase to the north tower. The reader is aware that this is the tower from which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bruges" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Hôtel-de-Ville</span> is visible. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> rose and followed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> ascended the tower staircase for the sake of ascending it, for the sake of seeing why the priest was ascending it. Moreover, the poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> did not know what he (<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>) should do, what he should say, what he wished. He was full of fury and full of fear. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> had come into conflict in his heart.</p>
<p>When he reached the summit of the tower, before emerging from the shadow of the staircase and stepping upon the platform, he cautiously examined the position of the priest. The priest's back was turned to him. There is an openwork <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span> which surrounds the platform of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell tower</span>. The priest, whose eyes looked down upon the town, was resting his breast on that one of the four sides of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrades</span> which looks upon the Pont Notre-Dame.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, advancing with the tread of a wolf behind him, went to see what he was gazing at thus.</p>
<p>The priest's attention was so absorbed elsewhere that he did not hear the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man walking behind him.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> is a magnificent and charming spectacle, and especially at that day, viewed from the top of the towers of Notre-Dame, in the fresh light of a summer dawn. The day might have been in July. The sky was perfectly serene. Some tardy stars were fading away at various points, and there was a very brilliant one in the east, in the brightest part of the heavens. The sun was about to appear; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> was beginning to move. A very white and very pure light brought out vividly to the eye all the outlines that its thousands of houses present to the east. The giant shadow of the towers leaped from roof to roof, from one end of the great city to the other. There were several quarters from which were already heard voices and noisy sounds. Here the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stroke" property="schema:name">stroke</span> of a bell, there the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stroke" property="schema:name">stroke</span> of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hammer" property="schema:name">hammer</span>, beyond, the complicated clatter of a cart in motion.</p>
<p>Already several columns of smoke were being belched forth from the chimneys scattered over the whole surface of roofs, as through the fissures of an immense sulphurous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volcanic_crater" property="schema:name">crater</span>. The river, which ruffles its waters against the arches of so many bridges, against the points of so many islands, was wavering with silvery folds. Around the city, outside the ramparts, sight was lost in a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_circle" property="schema:name">great circle</span> of fleecy vapors through which one confusedly distinguished the indefinite line of the plains, and the graceful swell of the heights. All sorts of floating sounds were dispersed over this half-awakened city. Towards the east, the morning breeze chased a few soft white bits of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wool" property="schema:name">wool</span> torn from the misty fleece of the hills.</p>
<p>In the Parvis, some good women, who had their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milk" property="schema:name">milk</span> jugs in their hands, were pointing out to each other, with astonishment, the singular dilapidation of the great door of Notre-Dame, and the two solidified streams of lead in the crevices of the stone. This was all that remained of the tempest of the night. The bonfire lighted between the towers by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had died out. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tristan" property="schema:name">Tristan</span> had already cleared up the Place, and had the dead thrown into the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>. Kings like <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. are careful to clean the pavement quickly after a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massacre" property="schema:name">massacre</span>.</p>
<p>Outside the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span> of the tower, directly under the point where the priest had paused, there was one of those fantastically carved stone gutters with which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> edifices bristle, and, in a crevice of that gutter, two pretty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Erysimum" property="schema:name">wallflowers</span> in blossom, shaken out and vivified, as it were, by the breath of air, made frolicsome salutations to each other. Above the towers, on high, far away in the depths of the sky, the cries of little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">birds</span> were heard.</p>
<p>But the priest was not listening to, was not looking at, anything of all this. He was one of the men for whom there are no mornings, no <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">birds</span>, no <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flower" property="schema:name">flowers</span>. In that immense <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horus" property="schema:name">horizon</span>, which assumed so many aspects about him, his contemplation was concentrated on a single point.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was burning to ask him what he had done with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>; but the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> seemed to be out of the world at that moment. He was evidently in one of those violent moments of life when one would not feel the earth crumble. He remained motionless and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span>, with his eyes steadily fixed on a certain point; and there was something so terrible about this silence and immobility that the savage <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> shuddered before it and dared not come in contact with it. Only, and this was also one way of interrogating the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, he followed the direction of his vision, and in this way the glance of the unhappy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man fell upon the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Place_de_l'Hôtel-de-Ville" property="schema:name">Place de Grève</span>.</p>
<p>Thus he saw what the priest was looking at. The ladder was erected near the permanent <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallows" property="schema:name">gallows</span>. There were some people and many soldiers in the Place. A man was dragging a white thing, from which hung something black, along the pavement. This man halted at the foot of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallows" property="schema:name">gallows</span>.</p>
<p>Here something took place which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> could not see very clearly. It was not because his only eye had not preserved its long range, but there was a group of soldiers which prevented his seeing everything. Moreover, at that moment the sun appeared, and such a flood of light overflowed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horus" property="schema:name">horizon</span> that one would have said that all the points in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, spires, chimneys, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gable" property="schema:name">gables</span>, had simultaneously taken fire.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the man began to mount the ladder. Then <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> saw him again distinctly. He was carrying a woman on his shoulder, a young girl dressed in white; that young girl had a noose about her neck. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> recognized her.</p>
<p>It was she.</p>
<p>The man reached the top of the ladder. There he arranged the noose. Here the priest, in order to see the better, knelt upon the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span>.</p>
<p>All at once the man kicked away the ladder abruptly, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, who had not breathed for several moments, beheld the unhappy child dangling at the end of the rope two <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fathom" property="schema:name">fathoms</span> above the pavement, with the man <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Squatting" property="schema:name">squatting</span> on her shoulders. The rope made several gyrations on itself, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> beheld horrible <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Convulsion" property="schema:name">convulsions</span> run along the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/False_hero" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s body. The priest, on his side, with outstretched neck and eyes starting from his head, contemplated this horrible group of the man and the young girl,—the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider" property="schema:name">spider</span> and the fly.</p>
<p>At the moment when it was most horrible, the laugh of a demon, a laugh which one can only give vent to when one is no longer human, burst forth on the priest's livid face.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> did not hear that laugh, but he saw it.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> retreated several paces behind the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, and suddenly <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hurling" property="schema:name">hurling</span> himself upon him with fury, with his huge hands he pushed him by the back over into the abyss over which Dom Claude was leaning.</p>
<p>The priest shrieked: "Damnation!" and fell.</p>
<p>The spout, above which he had stood, arrested him in his fall. He clung to it with desperate hands, and, at the moment when he opened his mouth to utter a second cry, he beheld the formidable and avenging face of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> thrust over the edge of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span> above his head.</p>
<p>Then he was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span>.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abyss_(Dungeons_&_Dragons)" property="schema:name">The abyss</span> was there below him. A fall of more than two hundred feet and the pavement.</p>
<p>In this terrible situation, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> said not a word, uttered not a groan. He merely writhed upon the spout, with incredible efforts to climb up again; but his hands had no hold on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Granite" property="schema:name">granite</span>, his feet slid along the blackened wall without catching fast. People who have ascended the towers of Notre-Dame know that there is a swell of the stone immediately beneath the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span>. It was on this retreating angle that miserable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> exhausted himself. He had not to deal with a perpendicular wall, but with one which sloped away beneath him.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had but to stretch out his hand in order to draw him from the gulf; but he did not even look at him. He was looking at the Grève. He was looking at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallows" property="schema:name">gallows</span>. He was looking at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man was leaning, with his elbows on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span>, at the spot where the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> had been a moment before, and there, never detaching his gaze from the only object which existed for him in the world at that moment, he remained motionless and mute, like a man struck by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lightning" property="schema:name">lightning</span>, and a long stream of tears flowed in silence from that eye which, up to that time, had never shed but one tear.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> was panting. His bald brow was dripping with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perspiration" property="schema:name">perspiration</span>, his nails were bleeding against the stones, his knees were <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flaying" property="schema:name">flayed</span> by the wall.</p>
<p>He heard his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cassock" property="schema:name">cassock</span>, which was caught on the spout, crack and rip at every jerk that he gave it. To complete his misfortune, this spout ended in a leaden pipe which bent under the weight of his body. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> felt this pipe slowly giving way. The miserable man said to himself that, when his hands should be worn out with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fatigue_(medical)" property="schema:name">fatigue</span>, when his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cassock" property="schema:name">cassock</span> should tear asunder, when the lead should give way, he would be obliged to fall, and terror seized upon his very vitals. Now and then he glanced wildly at a sort of narrow shelf formed, ten feet lower down, by projections of the sculpture, and he prayed heaven, from the depths of his distressed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, that he might be allowed to finish his life, were it to last two centuries, on that space two feet square. Once, he glanced below him into the Place, into the abyss; the head which he raised again had its eyes closed and its hair standing erect.</p>
<p>There was something frightful in the silence of these two men. While the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> agonized in this terrible fashion a few feet below him, Quasim<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Odo_(Star_Trek)" property="schema:name">odo</span> wept and gazed at the Grève.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, seeing that all his exertions served only to weaken the fragile support which remained to him, decided to remain quiet. There he hung, embracing the gutter, hardly breathing, no longer stirring, making no longer any other movements than that mechanical convulsion of the stomach, which one experiences in dreams when one fancies himself falling. His fixed eyes were wide open with a stare. He lost ground little by little, nevertheless, his fingers slipped along the spout; he became more and more conscious of the feebleness of his arms and the weight of his body. The curve of the lead which sustained him inclined more and more each instant towards the abyss.</p>
<p>He beheld below him, a frightful thing, the roof of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Jean</span> le Rond, as small as a card folded in two. He gazed at the impressive carvings, one by one, of the tower, suspended like himself over the precipice, but without terror for themselves or pity for him. All was stone around him; before his eyes, gaping monsters; below, quite at the bottom, in the Place, the pavement; above his head, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> weeping.</p>
<p>In the Parvis there were several groups of curious good people, who were tranquilly seeking to divine who the madman could be who was amusing himself in so strange a manner. The priest heard them saying, for their voices reached him, clear and shrill: "Why, he will break his neck!"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> wept.</p>
<p>At last the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, foaming with rage and despair, understood that all was in vain. Nevertheless, he collected all the strength which remained to him for a final effort. He stiffened himself upon the spout, pushed against the wall with both his knees, clung to a crevice in the stones with his hands, and succeeded in climbing back with one foot, perhaps; but this effort made the leaden beak on which he rested bend abruptly. His <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cassock" property="schema:name">cassock</span> burst open at the same time. Then, feeling everything give way beneath him, with nothing but his stiffened and failing hands to support him, the unfortunate man closed his eyes and let go of the spout. He fell.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> watched him fall.</p>
<p>A fall from such a height is seldom perpendicular. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, launched into space, fell at first head foremost, with outspread hands; then he whirled over and over many times; the wind blew him upon the roof of a house, where the unfortunate man began to break up. Nevertheless, he was not dead when he reached there. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> saw him still endeavor to cling to a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gable" property="schema:name">gable</span> with his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nail_(fastener)" property="schema:name">nails</span>; but the surface sloped too much, and he had no more strength. He slid rapidly along the roof like a loosened tile, and dashed upon the pavement. There he no longer moved.</p>
<p>Then <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> raised his eyes to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, whose body he beheld hanging from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span>, quivering far away beneath her white robe with the last shudderings of anguish, then he dropped them on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, stretched out at the base of the tower, and no longer retaining the human form, and he said, with a sob which heaved his deep chest,—"Oh! all that I have ever loved!"</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00075">CHAPTER III. THE MARRIAGE OF <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">PHOEBUS</span>.</h2>
<p>Towards evening on that day, when the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judiciary" property="schema:name">judiciary</span> officers of the bishop came to pick up from the pavement of the Parvis the dislocated corpse of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had disappeared.</p>
<p>A great many rumors were in circulation with regard to this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adventure_game" property="schema:name">adventure</span>. No one doubted but that the day had come when, in accordance with their compact, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, that is to say, the devil, was to carry off <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>, that is to say, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">sorcerer</span>. It was presumed that he had broken the body when taking the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, like monkeys who break the shell to get at the nut.</p>
<p>This is why the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> was not interred in consecrated earth.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. died a year later, in the month of August, 1483.</p>
<p>As for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span>, he succeeded in saving the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, and he won success in tragedy. It appears that, after having tasted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Astrology" property="schema:name">astrology</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosophy</span>, architecture, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermeticism" property="schema:name">hermetics</span>,—all vanities, he returned to tragedy, vainest pursuit of all. This is what he called "coming to a tragic end." This is what is to be read, on the subject of his dramatic triumphs, in 1483, in the accounts of the "Ordinary:" "To Jehan Marchand and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span>, carpenter and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Composer" property="schema:name">composer</span>, who have made and composed the mystery made at the Chãtelet of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, at the entry of Monsieur the Legate, and have ordered the personages, clothed and dressed the same, as in the said mystery was required; and likewise, for having made the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Council_of_the_Armed_Forces" property="schema:name">scaf</span>foldings thereto necessary; and for this deed,—one hundred <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_livre" property="schema:name">livres</span>."</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00076">CHAPTER IV. THE MARRIAGE OF <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">QUASIMODO</span>.</h2>
<p>We have just said that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> disappeared from Notre-Dame on the day of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s and of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>'s death. He was not seen again, in fact; no one knew what had become of him.</p>
<p>During the night which followed the execution of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span>, the night men had detached her body from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span>, and had carried it, according to custom, to the cellar of Montfauçon.</p>
<p>Montfauçon was, as Sauval says, "the most ancient and the most superb <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span> in the kingdom." Between the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Faubourg" property="schema:name">faubourgs</span> of the Temple and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_of_Tours" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint Martin</span>, about a hundred and sixty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toise" property="schema:name">toises</span> from the walls of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, a few bow shots from La Courtille, there was to be seen on the crest of a gentle, almost imperceptible eminence, but sufficiently elevated to be seen for several leagues round about, an edifice of strange form, bearing considerable resemblance to a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celts" property="schema:name">Celtic</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cromlech" property="schema:name">cromlech</span>, and where also <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_sacrifice" property="schema:name">human sacrifices</span> were offered.</p>
<p>Let the reader picture to himself, crowning a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Limestone" property="schema:name">limestone</span> hillock, an oblong mass of masonry fifteen feet in height, thirty wide, forty long, with a gate, an external railing and a platform; on this platform sixteen enormous pillars of rough hewn stone, thirty feet in height, arranged in a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Column" property="schema:name">colonnade</span> round three of the four sides of the mass which support them, bound together at their summits by heavy beams, whence hung chains at intervals; on all these chains, skeletons; in the vicinity, on the plain, a stone cross and two <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbets</span> of secondary importance, which seemed to have sprung up as shoots around the central <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallows" property="schema:name">gallows</span>; above all this, in the sky, a perpetual flock of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crow" property="schema:name">crows</span>; that was Montfauçon.</p>
<p>At the end of the fifteenth century, the formidable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span> which dated from 1328, was already very much dilapidated; the beams were wormeaten, the chains rusted, the pillars green with mould; the layers of hewn stone were all cracked at their joints, and grass was growing on that platform which no feet touched. The monument made a horrible profile against the sky; especially at night when there was a little moonlight on those white skulls, or when the breeze of evening brushed the chains and the skeletons, and swayed all these in the darkness. The presence of this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span> sufficed to render gloomy all the surrounding places.</p>
<p>The mass of masonry which served as foundation to the odious edifice was hollow. A huge cellar had been constructed there, closed by an old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> grating, which was out of order, into which were cast not only the human remains, which were taken from the chains of Montfauçon, but also the bodies of all the unfortunates executed on the other permanent <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbets</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. To that deep charnel-house, where so many human remains and so many crimes have rotted in company, many great ones of this world, many innocent people, have contributed their bones, from Enguerrand de Marigni, the first victim, and a just man, to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Admiral" property="schema:name">Admiral</span> de Coligni, who was its last, and who was also a just man.</p>
<p>As for the mysterious disappearance of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, this is all that we have been able to discover.</p>
<p>About eighteen months or two years after the events which terminate this story, when search was made in that cavern for the body of Olivier le Daim, who had been hanged two days previously, and to whom <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_VIII_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles VIII</span>. had granted the favor of being buried in Saint Laurent, in better company, they found among all those hideous carcasses two skeletons, one of which held the other in its embrace. One of these skeletons, which was that of a woman, still had a few strips of a garment which had once been white, and around her neck was to be seen a string of adrézarach beads with a little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silk" property="schema:name">silk</span> bag ornamented with green glass, which was open and empty. These objects were of so little value that the executioner had probably not cared for them. The other, which held this one in a close embrace, was the skeleton of a man. It was noticed that his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vertebral_column" property="schema:name">spinal column</span> was crooked, his head seated on his shoulder blades, and that one leg was shorter than the other. Moreover, there was no <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bone_fracture" property="schema:name">fracture</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vertebral_column" property="schema:name">vertebrae</span> at the nape of the neck, and it was evident that he had not been hanged. Hence, the man to whom it had belonged had come thither and had died there. When they tried to detach the skeleton which he held in his embrace, he fell to dust.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00077">NOTE</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00078">ADDED TO THE DEFINITIVE EDITION.</h3>
<p>It is by mistake that this edition was announced as augmented by many new chapters. The word should have been unpublished. In fact, if by new, newly made is to be understood, the chapters added to this edition are not new. They were written at the same time as the rest of the work; they date from the same epoch, and sprang from the same thought, they have always formed a part of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manuscript" property="schema:name">manuscript</span> of "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Notre_Dame_de_Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Notre-Dame-de-Paris</span>." Moreover, the author cannot comprehend how fresh developments could be added to a work of this character after its completion. This is not to be done at will. According to his idea, a romance is born in a manner that is, in some sort, necessary, with all its chapters; a drama is born with all its scenes. Think not that there is anything arbitrary in the numbers of parts of which that whole, that mysterious microcosm which you call a drama or a romance, is composed. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grafting" property="schema:name">Grafting</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soldering" property="schema:name">soldering</span> take badly on works of this nature, which should gush forth in a single stream and so remain. The thing once done, do not change your mind, do not touch it up. The book once published, the sex of the work, whether virile or not, has been recognized and proclaimed; when the child has once uttered his first cry he is born, there he is, he is made so, neither father nor mother can do anything, he belongs to the air and to the sun, let him live or die, such as he is. Has your book been a failure? So much the worse. Add no chapters to an unsuccessful book. Is it incomplete? You should have completed it when you conceived it. Is your tree crooked? You cannot straighten it up. Is your romance consumptive? Is your romance not capable of living? You cannot supply it with the breath which it lacks. Has your drama been born lame? Take my advice, and do not provide it with a wooden leg.</p>
<p>Hence the author attaches particular importance to the public knowing for a certainty that the chapters here added have not been made expressly for this reprint. They were not published in the preceding editions of the book for a very simple reason. At the time when "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Notre_Dame_de_Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Notre-Dame-de-Paris</span>" was printed the first time, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manuscript" property="schema:name">manuscript</span> of these three chapters had been mislaid. It was necessary to rewrite them or to dispense with them. The author considered that the only two of these chapters which were in the least important, owing to their extent, were chapters on art and history which in no way interfered with the groundwork of the drama and the romance, that the public would not notice their loss, and that he, the author, would alone be in possession of the secret. He decided to omit them, and then, if the whole truth must be confessed, his indolence shrunk from the task of rewriting the three lost chapters. He would have found it a shorter matter to make a new romance.</p>
<p>Now the chapters have been found, and he avails himself of the first opportunity to restore them to their place.</p>
<p>This now, is his entire work, such as he dreamed it, such as he made it, good or bad, durable or fragile, but such as he wishes it.</p>
<p>These recovered chapters will possess no doubt, but little value in the eyes of persons, otherwise very judicious, who have sought in "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Notre_Dame_de_Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Notre-Dame-de-Paris</span>" only the drama, the romance. But there are perchance, other readers, who have not found it useless to study the aesthetic and philosophic thought concealed in this book, and who have taken pleasure, while reading "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Notre_Dame_de_Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Notre-Dame-de-Paris</span>," in unravelling beneath the romance something else than the romance, and in following (may we be pardoned these rather ambitious expressions), the system of the historian and the aim of the artist through the creation of the poet.</p>
<p>For such people especially, the chapters added to this edition will complete "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Notre_Dame_de_Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Notre-Dame-de-Paris</span>," if we admit that "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Notre_Dame_de_Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Notre-Dame-de-Paris</span>" was worth the trouble of completing.</p>
<p>In one of these chapters on the present decadence of architecture, and on the death (in his mind almost inevitable) of that king of arts, the author expresses and develops an opinion unfortunately well rooted in him, and well thought out. But he feels it necessary to say here that he earnestly desires that the future may, some day, put him in the wrong. He knows that art in all its forms has everything to hope from the new generations whose genius, still in the germ, can be heard gushing forth in our studios. The grain is in the furrow, the harvest will certainly be fine. He merely fears, and the reason may be seen in the second volume of this edition, that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plant_sap" property="schema:name">sap</span> may have been withdrawn from that ancient soil of architecture which has been for so many centuries the best field for art.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are to-day in the artistic youth so much life, power, and, so to speak, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Predestination" property="schema:name">predestination</span>, that in our schools of architecture in particular, at the present time, the professors, who are detestable, produce, not only unconsciously but even in spite of themselves, excellent pupils; quite the reverse of that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pottery" property="schema:name">potter</span> mentioned by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Horace</span>, who dreamed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphora" property="schema:name">amphorae</span> and produced pots. <i>Currit rota, urcens exit</i>.</p>
<p>But, in any case, whatever may be the future of architecture, in whatever manner our young architects may one day solve the question of their art, let us, while waiting for new monument, preserve the ancient monuments. Let us, if possible, inspire the nation with a love for national architecture. That, the author declares, is one of the principal aims of this book; it is one of the principal aims of his life.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Notre_Dame_de_Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Notre-Dame-de-Paris</span>" has, perhaps opened some true perspectives on the art of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span>, on that marvellous art which up to the present time has been unknown to some, and, what is worse, misknown by others. But the author is far from regarding as accomplished, the task which he has voluntarily imposed on himself. He has already pleaded on more than one occasion, the cause of our ancient architecture, he has already loudly denounced many profanations, many demolitions, many impieties. He will not grow weary. He has promised himself to recur frequently to this subject. He will return to it. He will be as indefatigable in defending our historical edifices as our <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iconoclasm" property="schema:name">iconoclasts</span> of the schools and academies are eager in attacking them; for it is a grievous thing to see into what hands the architecture of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span> has fallen, and in what a manner the botchers of plaster of the present day treat the ruin of this grand art, it is even a shame for us intelligent men who see them at work and content ourselves with hooting them. And we are not speaking here merely of what goes on in the provinces, but of what is done in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> at our very doors, beneath our windows, in the great city, in the lettered city, in the city of the press, of word, of thought. We cannot resist the impulse to point out, in concluding this note, some of the acts of vandalism which are every day planned, debated, begun, continued, and successfully completed under the eyes of the artistic public of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, face to face with criticism, which is disconcerted by so much audacity. An archbishop's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace" property="schema:name">palace</span> has just been demolished, an edifice in poor taste, no great harm is done; but in a block with the archiepiscopal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace" property="schema:name">palace</span> a bishop's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace" property="schema:name">palace</span> has been demolished, a rare fragment of the fourteenth century, which the demolishing architect could not distinguish from the rest. He has torn up the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wheat" property="schema:name">wheat</span> with the tares; 'tis all the same. They are talking of razing the admirable chapel of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vincennes" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Vincennes</span>, in order to make, with its stones, some fortification, which Daumesnil did not need, however. While the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palais_Bourbon" property="schema:name">Palais Bourbon</span>, that wretched edifice, is being repaired at great expense, gusts of wind and equinoctial storms are allowed to destroy the magnificent painted windows of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sainte-Chapelle" property="schema:name">Sainte-Chapelle</span>. For the last few days there has been a scaffolding on the tower of Saint Jacques de la Boucherie; and one of these mornings the pick will be laid to it. A mason has been found to build a little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/White_House" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">white house</span> between the venerable towers of the Palais de-Justice. Another has been found willing to prune away Saint-Germain-des-Pres, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feudalism" property="schema:name">feudal</span> abbey with three <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell towers</span>. Another will be found, no doubt, capable of pulling down Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois. All these masons claim to be architects, are paid by the prefecture or from the petty budget, and wear green coats. All the harm which false taste can inflict on good taste, they accomplish. While we write, deplorable spectacle! one of them holds possession of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tuileries_Palace" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Tuileries</span>, one of them is giving <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philibert_de_l'Orme" property="schema:name">Philibert Delorme</span> a scar across the middle of his face; and it is not, assuredly, one of the least of the scandals of our time to see with what effrontery the heavy architecture of this gentleman is being flattened over one of the most delicate façades of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance" property="schema:name">Renaissance</span>!</p>
