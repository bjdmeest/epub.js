<p>There were no great proofs of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">sorcery</span> in that, after all, but there was still enough smoke to warrant a surmise of fire, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> bore a tolerably formidable reputation. We ought to mention however, that the sciences of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egypt</span>, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Necromancy" property="schema:name">necromancy</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span>, even the whitest, even the most innocent, had no more envenomed enemy, no more pitiless denunciator before the gentlemen of the officialty of Notre-Dame. Whether this was sincere <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horror_fiction" property="schema:name">horror</span>, or the game played by the thief who shouts, "stop thief!" at all events, it did not prevent the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> from being considered by the learned heads of the chapter, as a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> who had ventured into the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vestibule_(architecture)" property="schema:name">vestibule</span> of hell, who was lost in the caves of the cabal, groping amid the shadows of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Occult" property="schema:name">occult</span> sciences. Neither were the people deceived thereby; with any one who possessed any sagacity, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> passed for the demon; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>, for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magician_(fantasy)" property="schema:name">sorcerer</span>. It was evident that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> was to serve the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> for a given time, at the end of which he would carry away the latter's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, by way of payment. Thus the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, in spite of the excessive <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asceticism" property="schema:name">austerity</span> of his life, was in bad odor among all pious souls; and there was no devout nose so inexperienced that it could not smell him out to be a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magician_(fantasy)" property="schema:name">magician</span>.</p>
<p>And if, as he grew older, abysses had formed in his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span>, they had also formed in his heart. That at least, is what one had grounds for believing on scrutinizing that face upon which the soul was only seen to shine through a sombre cloud. Whence that large, bald brow? that head forever bent? that breast always heaving with sighs? What secret thought caused his mouth to smile with so much bitterness, at the same moment that his scowling brows approached each other like two bulls on the point of fighting? Why was what hair he had left already gray? What was that internal fire which sometimes broke forth in his glance, to such a degree that his eye resembled a hole pierced in the wall of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span>?</p>
<p>These symptoms of a violent moral preoccupation, had acquired an especially high degree of intensity at the epoch when this story takes place. More than once a choir-boy had fled in terror at finding him alone in the church, so strange and dazzling was his look. More than once, in the choir, at the hour of the offices, his neighbor in the stalls had heard him mingle with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plainsong" property="schema:name">plain song</span>, <i>ad omnem tonum</i>, unintelligible parentheses. More than once the laundress of the Terrain charged "with washing the chapter" had observed, not without affright, the marks of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nail_(anatomy)" property="schema:name">nails</span> and clenched fingers on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surplice" property="schema:name">surplice</span> of monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> of Josas.</p>
<p>However, he redoubled his severity, and had never been more exemplary. By profession as well as by character, he had always held himself aloof from women; he seemed to hate them more than ever. The mere rustling of a silken petticoat caused his hood to fall over his eyes. Upon this score he was so jealous of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asceticism" property="schema:name">austerity</span> and reserve, that when the Dame de Beaujeu, the king's daughter, came to visit the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span> of Notre-Dame, in the month of December, 1481, he gravely opposed her entrance, reminding the bishop of the statute of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blackest_Night" property="schema:name">Black Book</span>, dating from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vigil" property="schema:name">vigil</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Barthélemy" property="schema:name">Saint-Barthélemy</span>, 1334, which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interdict" property="schema:name">interdicts</span> access to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span> to "any woman whatever, old or young, mistress or maid." Upon which the bishop had been constrained to recite to him the ordinance of Legate <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Odo,_Earl_of_Kent" property="schema:name">Odo</span>, which excepts certain great dames, <i>aliquae <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magnate" property="schema:name">magnates</span> mulieres, quae <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sine" property="schema:name">sine</span> scandalo vitari non possunt</i>. And again the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diocese" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> had protested, objecting that the ordinance of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Papal_legate" property="schema:name">legate</span>, which dated back to 1207, was anterior by a hundred and twenty-seven years to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blackest_Night" property="schema:name">Black Book</span>, and consequently was abrogated in fact by it. And he had refused to appear before the princess.</p>
<p>It was also noticed that his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horror_fiction" property="schema:name">horror</span> for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span> women and gypsies had seemed to redouble for some time past. He had petitioned the bishop for an edict which expressly forbade the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span> women to come and dance and beat their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourines</span> on the place of the Parvis; and for about the same length of time, he had been ransacking the mouldy placards of the officialty, in order to collect the cases of sorcerers and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witches</span> condemned to fire or the rope, for complicity in crimes with rams, sows, or <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goats</span>.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00030">CHAPTER VI. UNPOPULARITY.</h2>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diocese" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span>, as we have already said, were but little loved by the populace great and small, in the vicinity of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" property="schema:name">cat</span>hedral. When Claude and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> went out together, which frequently happened, and when they were seen traversing in company, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Valet" property="schema:name">valet</span> behind the master, the cold, narrow, and gloomy streets of the block of Notre-Dame, more than one evil word, more than one ironical quaver, more than one insulting jest greeted them on their way, unless <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>, which was rarely the case, walked with head upright and raised, showing his severe and almost august brow to the dumbfounded jeerers.</p>
<p>Both were in their quarter like "the poets" of whom Régnier speaks,—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">   "All sorts of persons run after poets,<br/>   As warblers fly shrieking after owls."<br/></div>
<p>Sometimes a mischievous child risked his skin and bones for the ineffable pleasure of driving a pin into <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>'s hump. Again, a young girl, more bold and saucy than was fitting, brushed the priest's black robe, singing in his face the sardonic ditty, "niche, niche, the devil is caught." Sometimes a group of squalid old crones, squatting in a file under the shadow of the steps to a porch, scolded noisily as the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> passed, and tossed them this encouraging welcome, with a curse: "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hum_(band)" property="schema:name">Hum</span>! there's a fellow whose <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> is made like the other one's body!" Or a band of schoolboys and street urchins, playing hop-scotch, rose in a body and saluted him classically, with some cry in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span>: "<i>Eia! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Environmental_impact_assessment" property="schema:name">eia</span>! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claudius" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claudius</span> cum claudo</i>!"</p>
<p>But the insult generally passed unnoticed both by the priest and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span>. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was too <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> to hear all these gracious things, and Claude was too dreamy.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00032">CHAPTER I. <i>ABBAS BEATI MARTINI</i>.</h2>
<p>Dom Claude's fame had spread far and wide. It procured for him, at about the epoch when he refused to see Madame de Beaujeu, a visit which he long remembered.</p>
<p>It was in the evening. He had just retired, after the office, to his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canon_(priest)" property="schema:name">canon</span>'s cell in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span> of Notre-Dame. This cell, with the exception, possibly, of some glass phials, relegated to a corner, and filled with a decidedly equivocal powder, which strongly resembled the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alchemy" property="schema:name">alchemist</span>'s "powder of projection," presented nothing strange or mysterious. There were, indeed, here and there, some inscriptions on the walls, but they were pure sentences of learning and piety, extracted from good authors. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> had just seated himself, by the light of a three-jetted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copper" property="schema:name">copper</span> lamp, before a vast coffer crammed with manuscripts. He had rested his elbow upon the open volume of <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Honorius_(emperor)" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Honorius</span> d'Autun</i>, <i>De predestinatione et libero arbitrio</i>, and he was turning over, in deep <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Meditation" property="schema:name">meditation</span>, the leaves of a printed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bookbinding" property="schema:name">folio</span> which he had just brought, the sole product of the press which his cell contained. In the midst of his revery there came a knock at his door. "Who's there?" cried the learned man, in the gracious tone of a famished <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">dog</span>, disturbed over his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bone" property="schema:name">bone</span>.</p>
<p>A voice without replied, "Your friend, Jacques Coictier." He went to open the door.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, the king's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span>; a person about fifty years of age, whose harsh physiognomy was modified only by a crafty eye. Another man accompanied him. Both wore long slate-colored robes, furred with minever, girded and closed, with caps of the same stuff and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hue" property="schema:name">hue</span>. Their hands were concealed by their sleeves, their feet by their robes, their eyes by their caps.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> help me, messieurs!" said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, showing them in; "I was not expecting distinguished visitors at such an hour." And while speaking in this courteous fashion he cast an uneasy and scrutinizing glance from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span> to his companion.</p>
<p>"'Tis never too late to come and pay a visit to so considerable a learned man as Dom <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> de Tirechappe," replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doctor_(Doctor_Who)" property="schema:name">Doctor</span> Coictier, whose <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franche-Comté" property="schema:name">Franche-Comté</span> accent made all his phrases <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drag_(clothing)" property="schema:name">drag</span> along with the majesty of a train-robe.</p>
<p>There then ensued between the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> one of those congratulatory prologues which, in accordance with custom, at that epoch preceded all conversations between learned men, and which did not prevent them from detesting each other in the most cordial manner in the world. However, it is the same nowadays; every wise man's mouth complimenting another wise man is a vase of honeyed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gall" property="schema:name">gall</span>.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>'s felicitations to Jacques Coictier bore reference principally to the temporal advantages which the worthy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span> had found means to extract, in the course of his much envied career, from each malady of the king, an operation of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alchemy" property="schema:name">alchemy</span> much better and more certain than the pursuit of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span>'s stone.</p>
<p>"In truth, Monsieur le Docteur Coictier, I felt great joy on learning of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diocese" property="schema:name">bishopric</span> given your nephew, my reverend <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord" property="schema:name">seigneur</span> Pierre Verse. Is he not Bishop of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amiens" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Amiens</span>?"</p>
<p>"Yes, monsieur <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">Archdeacon</span>; it is a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_grace" property="schema:name">grace</span> and mercy of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>."</p>
<p>"Do you know that you made a great figure on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christmas" property="schema:name">Christmas Day</span> at the bead of your company of the chamber of accounts, Monsieur President?"</p>
<p>"Vice-President, Dom Claude. Alas! nothing more."</p>
<p>"How is your superb house in the Rue Saint-André des Arcs coming on? 'Tis a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Louvre" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Louvre</span>. I love greatly the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apricot" property="schema:name">apricot</span> tree which is carved on the door, with this play of words: 'A L'ABRI-COTIER—Sheltered from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coral_reef" property="schema:name">reefs</span>.'"</p>
<p>"Alas! Master Claude, all that masonry costeth me dear. In proportion as the house is erected, I am ruined."</p>
<p>"Ho! have you not your revenues from the jail, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiwick" property="schema:name">bailiwick</span> of the Palais, and the rents of all the houses, sheds, stalls, and booths of the enclosure? 'Tis a fine breast to suck."</p>
<p>"My castellany of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poissy" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Poissy</span> has brought me in nothing this year."</p>
<p>"But your tolls of Triel, of Saint-James, of Saint-Germainen-Laye are always good."</p>
<p>"Six score <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span>, and not even Parisian <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span> at that."</p>
<p>"You have your office of counsellor to the king. That is fixed."</p>
<p>"Yes, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Haunted_Mansion_characters" property="schema:name">brother Claude</span>; but that accursed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord" property="schema:name">seigneury</span> of Poligny, which people make so much noise about, is worth not sixty gold crowns, year out and year in."</p>
<p>In the compliments which Dom Claude addressed to Jacques Coictier, there was that sardonical, biting, and covertly mocking accent, and the sad cruel smile of a superior and unhappy man who toys for a moment, by way of distraction, with the dense prosperity of a vulgar man. The other did not perceive it.</p>
<p>"Upon my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>," said Claude at length, pressing his hand, "I am glad to see you and in such good health."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Master Claude."</p>
<p>"By the way," exclaimed Dom Claude, "how is your royal patient?"</p>
<p>"He payeth not sufficiently his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span>," replied the doctor, casting a side glance at his companion.</p>
<p>"Think you so, Gossip Coictier," said the latter.</p>
<p>These words, uttered in a tone of surprise and reproach, drew upon this unknown personage the attention of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> which, to tell the truth, had not been diverted from him a single moment since the stranger had set foot across the threshold of his cell. It had even required all the thousand reasons which he had for handling tenderly <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doctor_(Doctor_Who)" property="schema:name">Doctor</span> Jacques Coictier, the all-powerful <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span> of King <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>., to induce him to receive the latter thus accompanied. Hence, there was nothing very cordial in his manner when Jacques Coictier said to him,—</p>
<p>"By the way, Dom Claude, I bring you a colleague who has desired to see you on account of your reputation."</p>
<p>"Monsieur belongs to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span>?" asked the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, fixing his piercing eye upon Coictier's companion. He found beneath the brows of the stranger a glance no less piercing or less distrustful than his own.</p>
<p>He was, so far as the feeble light of the lamp permitted one to judge, an old man about sixty years of age and of medium stature, who appeared somewhat sickly and broken in health. His profile, although of a very ordinary outline, had something powerful and severe about it; his eyes sparkled beneath a very deep superciliary arch, like a light in the depths of a cave; and beneath his cap which was well drawn down and fell upon his nose, one recognized the broad expanse of a brow of genius.</p>
<p>He took it upon himself to reply to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>'s question,—</p>
<p>"Reverend master," he said in a grave tone, "your renown has reached my ears, and I wish to consult you. I am but a poor provincial gentleman, who removeth his shoes before entering the dwellings of the learned. You must know my name. I am called Gossip Tourangeau."</p>
<p>"Strange name for a gentleman," said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> to himself.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he had a feeling that he was in the presence of a strong and earnest character. The instinct of his own lofty intellect made him recognize an intellect no less lofty under Gossip Tourangeau's furred cap, and as he gazed at the solemn face, the ironical smile which Jacques Coictier's presence called forth on his gloomy face, gradually disappeared as twilight fades on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soil_horizon" property="schema:name">horizon</span> of night. Stern and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span>, he had resumed his seat in his great armchair; his elbow rested as usual, on the table, and his brow on his hand. After a few moments of reflection, he motioned his visitors to be seated, and, turning to Gossip Tourangeau he said,—</p>
<p>"You come to consult me, master, and upon what <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classified_information_in_the_United_States" property="schema:name">sci</span>ence?"</p>
<p>"Your rever<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Instituto_Nacional_de_Industria" property="schema:name">ence</span>," replied Tourangeau, "I am ill, very ill. You are said to be great <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asclepius" property="schema:name">AEsculapius</span>, and I am come to ask your advice in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medicine" property="schema:name">medicine</span>."</p>
<p>"Medicine!" said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, tossing his head. He seemed to meditate for a moment, and then resumed: "Gossip Tourangeau, since that is your name, turn your head, you will find my reply already written on the wall."</p>
<p>Gossip Tourangeau obeyed, and read this inscription engraved above his head: "Medicine is the daughter of dreams.—JAMBLIQUE."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Doctor Jacques Coictier had heard his companion's question with a displeasure which Dom Claude's response had but redoubled. He bent down to the ear of Gossip Tourangeau, and said to him, softly enough not to be heard by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>: "I warned you that he was mad. You insisted on seeing him."</p>
<p>"'Tis very possible that he is right, madman as he is, Doctor Jacques," replied his comrade in the same low tone, and with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>"As you please," replied Coictier dryly. Then, addressing the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>: "You are clever at your trade, Dom Claude, and you are no more at a loss over <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippocrates" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Hippocrates</span> than a monkey is over a nut. Medicine a dream! I suspect that the pharmacopolists and the master physicians would insist upon <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stoning" property="schema:name">stoning</span> you if they were here. So you deny the influence of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Potion" property="schema:name">philtres</span> upon the blood, and unguents on the skin! You deny that eternal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pharmacy" property="schema:name">pharmacy</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flower" property="schema:name">flowers</span> and metals, which is called the world, made expressly for that eternal invalid called man!"</p>
<p>"I deny," said Dom Claude coldly, "neither <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pharmacy" property="schema:name">pharmacy</span> nor the invalid. I reject the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span>."</p>
<p>"Then it is not true," resumed Coictier hotly, "that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gout" property="schema:name">gout</span> is an internal eruption; that a wound caused by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artillery" property="schema:name">artillery</span> is to be cured by the application of a young <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouse" property="schema:name">mouse</span> roasted; that young blood, properly injected, restores youth to aged <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vein" property="schema:name">veins</span>; it is not true that two and two make four, and that emprostathonos follows opistathonos."</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> replied without <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perturbation_(astronomy)" property="schema:name">perturbation</span>: "There are certain things of which I think in a certain fashion."</p>
<p>Coictier became crimson with anger.</p>
<p>"There, there, my good Coictier, let us not get angry," said Gossip Tourangeau. "Monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> is our friend."</p>
<p>Coictier calmed down, muttering in a low tone,—</p>
<p>"After all, he's mad."</p>
<p>"<i>Pasque-dieu</i>, Master Claude," resumed Gossip Tourangeau, after a silence, "You embarrass me greatly. I had two things to consult you upon, one touching my health and the other touching my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celebrity" property="schema:name">star</span>."</p>
<p>"Monsieur," returned the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, "if that be your motive, you would have done as well not to put yourself out of breath climbing my staircase. I do not believe in Medicine. I do not believe in Astrology."</p>
<p>"Indeed!" said the man, with surprise.</p>
<p>Coictier gave a forced laugh.</p>
<p>"You see that he is mad," he said, in a low tone, to Gossip Tourangeau. "He does not believe in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Astrology" property="schema:name">astrology</span>."</p>
<p>"The idea of imagining," pursued Dom Claude, "that every ray of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celebrity" property="schema:name">star</span> is a thread which is fastened to the head of a man!"</p>
<p>"And what then, do you believe in?" exclaimed Gossip Tourangeau.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> hesitated for a moment, then he allowed a gloomy smile to escape, which seemed to give the lie to his response: "<i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Credo" property="schema:name">Credo</span> in Deum</i>."</p>
<p>"<i>Dominum nostrum</i>," added Gossip Tourangeau, making the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amen" property="schema:name">Amen</span>," said Coictier.</p>
<p>"Reverend master," resumed Tourangeau, "I am charmed in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> to see you in such a religious frame of mind. But have you reached the point, great savant as you are, of no longer believing in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span>?"</p>
<p>"No," said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, grasping the arm of Gossip Tourangeau, and a ray of enthusiasm lighted up his gloomy eyes, "no, I do not reject <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span>. I have not crawled so long, flat on my belly, with my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nail_(anatomy)" property="schema:name">nails</span> in the earth, through the innumerable ramifications of its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cave" property="schema:name">caverns</span>, without perceiving far in front of me, at the end of the obscure gallery, a light, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flame" property="schema:name">flame</span>, a something, the reflection, no doubt, of the dazzling central laboratory where the patient and the wise have found out <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>."</p>
<p>"And in short," interrupted Tourangeau, "what do you hold to be true and certain?"</p>
<p>"Alchemy."</p>
<p>Coictier exclaimed, "Pardieu, Dom Claude, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alchemy" property="schema:name">alchemy</span> has its use, no doubt, but why blaspheme <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medicine" property="schema:name">medicine</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Astrology" property="schema:name">astrology</span>?"</p>
<p>"Naught is your <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span> of man, naught is your <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span> of the stars," said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, commandingly.</p>
<p>"That's driving <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epidaurus" typeof="schema:AdministrativeArea" property="schema:name">Epidaurus</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chaldea" property="schema:name">Chaldea</span> very fast," replied the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medicine" property="schema:name">physician</span> with a grin.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Listen_(Beyoncé_Knowles_song)" property="schema:name">Listen</span>, Messire Jacques. This is said in good faith. I am not the king's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medicine" property="schema:name">physician</span>, and his majesty has not given me the Garden of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daedalus" property="schema:name">Daedalus</span> in which to observe the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constellation" property="schema:name">constellations</span>. Don't get angry, but listen to me. What truth have you deduced, I will not say from medicine, which is too foolish a thing, but from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Astrology" property="schema:name">astrology</span>? Cite to me the virtues of the vertical <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boustrophedon" property="schema:name">boustrophedon</span>, the treasures of the number ziruph and those of the number zephirod!"</p>
<p>"Will you deny," said Coictier, "the sympathetic <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clavicle" property="schema:name">collar bone</span>, and the cabalistics which are derived from it?"</p>
<p>"An error, Messire Jacques! None of your formulas end in reality. Alchemy on the other hand has its discoveries. Will you contest results like this? Ice confined beneath the earth for a thousand years is transformed into <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rock_(geology)" property="schema:name">rock</span> crystals. Lead is the ancestor of all metals. For gold is not a metal, gold is light. Lead requires only four periods of two hundred years each, to pass in succession from the state of lead, to the state of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arsenic" property="schema:name">arsenic</span>, from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arsenic" property="schema:name">arsenic</span> to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tin" property="schema:name">tin</span>, from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tin" property="schema:name">tin</span> to silver. Are not these facts? But to believe in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clavicle" property="schema:name">collar bone</span>, in the full line and in the stars, is as ridiculous as to believe with the inhabitants of Grand-Cathay that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eurasian_Golden_Oriole" property="schema:name">golden oriole</span> turns into a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mole_(unit)" property="schema:name">mole</span>, and that grains of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wheat" property="schema:name">wheat</span> turn into <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fish" property="schema:name">fish</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carp" property="schema:name">carp</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Species" property="schema:name">species</span>."</p>
<p>"I have studied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermeticism" property="schema:name">hermetic</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span>!" exclaimed Coictier, "and I affirm—"</p>
<p>The fiery <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> did not allow him to finish: "And I have studied medicine, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Astrology" property="schema:name">astrology</span>, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermeticism" property="schema:name">hermetics</span>. Here alone is the truth." (As he spoke thus, he took from the top of the coffer a phial filled with the powder which we have mentioned above), "here alone is light! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippocrates" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Hippocrates</span> is a dream; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urania" property="schema:name">Urania</span> is a dream; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermes" property="schema:name">Hermes</span>, a thought. Gold is the sun; to make gold is to be <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>. Herein lies the one and only <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span>. I have sounded the depths of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medicine" property="schema:name">medicine</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Astrology" property="schema:name">astrology</span>, I tell you! Naught, nothingness! The human body, shadows! the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Astrology" property="schema:name">planets</span>, shadows!"</p>
<p>And he fell back in his armchair in a commanding and inspired attitude. Gossip Touraugeau watched him in silence. Coictier tried to grin, shrugged his shoulders imperceptibly, and repeated in a low voice,—</p>
<p>"A madman!"</p>
<p>"And," said Tourangeau suddenly, "the wondrous result,—have you attained it, have you made gold?"</p>
<p>"If I had made it," replied the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, articulating his words slowly, like a man who is reflecting, "the king of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span> would be named Claude and not Louis."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stranger_(comics)" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">The stranger</span> frowned.</p>
<p>"What am I saying?" resumed Dom Claude, with a smile of disdain. "What would the throne of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span> be to me when I could rebuild the empire of the Orient?"</p>
<p>"Very good!" said the stranger.</p>
<p>"Oh, the poor fool!" <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathy_voice" property="schema:name">murmured</span> Coictier.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> went on, appearing to reply now only to his thoughts,—</p>
<p>"But no, I am still crawling; I am <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scratching" property="schema:name">scratching</span> my face and knees against the pebbles of the subterranean pathway. I catch a glimpse, I do not contemplate! I do not read, I spell out!"</p>
<p>"And when you know how to read!" demanded the stranger, "will you make gold?"</p>
<p>"Who doubts it?" said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>.</p>
<p>"In that case Our Lady knows that I am greatly in need of money, and I should much desire to read in your books. Tell me, reverend master, is your <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span> inimical or displeasing to Our Lady?"</p>
<p>"Whose <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> I am?" Dom Claude contented himself with replying, with tranquil hauteur.</p>
<p>"That is true, my master. Well! will it please you to initiate me? Let me spell with you."</p>
<p>Claude assumed the majestic and pontifical attitude of a Samuel.</p>
<p>"Old man, it requires longer years than remain to you, to undertake this voyage across mysterious things. Your head is very gray! One comes forth from the cavern only with white hair, but only those with dark hair enter it. Science alone knows well how to hollow, wither, and dry up human faces; she needs not to have old age bring her faces already furrowed. Nevertheless, if the desire possesses you of putting yourself under discipline at your age, and of deciphering the formidable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egyptian_hieroglyphs" property="schema:name">alphabet</span> of the sages, come to me; 'tis well, I will make the effort. I will not tell you, poor old man, to go and visit the sepulchral chambers of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyramid" property="schema:name">pyramids</span>, of which ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Herodotus</span> speaks, nor the brick tower of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon" property="schema:name">Babylon</span>, nor the immense white <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> sanctuary of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/India" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Indian</span> temple of Eklinga. I, no more than yourself, have seen the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon" property="schema:name">Chaldean</span> masonry works constructed according to the sacred form of the Sikra, nor the temple of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solomon" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Solomon</span>, which is destroyed, nor the stone doors of the sepulchre of the kings of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Israelites" property="schema:name">Israel</span>, which are broken. We will content ourselves with the fragments of the book of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermes" property="schema:name">Hermes</span> which we have here. I will explain to you the statue of Saint Christopher, the symbol of the sower, and that of the two <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angel" property="schema:name">angels</span> which are on the front of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sainte-Chapelle" property="schema:name">Sainte-Chapelle</span>, and one of which holds in his hands a vase, the other, a cloud—"</p>
<p>Here Jacques Coictier, who had been unhorsed by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>'s impetuous replies, regained his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saddle" property="schema:name">saddle</span>, and interrupted him with the triumphant tone of one learned man correcting another,—"<i>Erras amice Claudi</i>. The symbol is not the number. You take <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orpheus" property="schema:name">Orpheus</span> for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermes" property="schema:name">Hermes</span>."</p>
<p>"'Tis you who are in error," replied the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, gravely. "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daedalus" property="schema:name">Daedalus</span> is the base; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orpheus" property="schema:name">Orpheus</span> is the wall; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermes" property="schema:name">Hermes</span> is the edifice,—that is all. You shall come when you will," he continued, turning to Tourangeau, "I will show you the little parcels of gold which remained at the bottom of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolas_Flamel" property="schema:name">Nicholas Flamel</span>'s <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alembic" property="schema:name">alembic</span>, and you shall compare them with the gold of Guillaume de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. I will teach you the secret virtues of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Greek</span> word, <i>peristera</i>. But, first of all, I will make you read, one after the other, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> letters of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egyptian_hieroglyphs" property="schema:name">alphabet</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Granite" property="schema:name">granite</span> pages of the book. We shall go to the portal of Bishop Guillaume and of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Jean</span> le Rond at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sainte-Chapelle" property="schema:name">Sainte-Chapelle</span>, then to the house of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolas_Flamel" property="schema:name">Nicholas Flamel</span>, Rue Manvault, to his tomb, which is at the Saints-Innocents, to his two hospitals, Rue de Montmorency. I will make you read the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egyptian_hieroglyphs" property="schema:name">hieroglyphics</span> which cover the four great <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Menstruation" property="schema:name">cramps</span> on the portal of the hospital <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/St-Gervais-et-St-Protais" property="schema:name">Saint-Gervais</span>, and of the Rue de la Ferronnerie. We will spell out in company, also, the façade of Saint-Come, of Sainte-Geneviève-des-Ardents, of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_of_Tours" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint Martin</span>, of Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie—."</p>
<p>For a long time, Gossip Tourangeau, intelligent as was his glance, had appeared not to understand Dom Claude. He interrupted.</p>
<p>"<i>Pasque-dieu</i>! what are your books, then?"</p>
<p>"Here is one of them," said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>.</p>
<p>And opening the window of his cell he pointed out with his finger the immense church of Notre-Dame, which, outlining against the starry sky the black silhouette of its two towers, its stone flanks, its monstrous haunches, seemed an enormous two-headed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sphinx" property="schema:name">sphinx</span>, seated in the middle of the city.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> gazed at the gigantic edifice for some time in silence, then extending his right hand, with a sigh, towards the printed book which lay open on the table, and his left towards Notre-Dame, and turning a sad glance from the book to the church,—"Alas," he said, "this will kill that."</p>
<p>Coictier, who had eagerly approached the book, could not repress an exclamation. "Hé, but now, what is there so formidable in this: 'GLOSSA IN EPISTOLAS D. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wolfgang_Pauli" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">PAULI</span>, <i>Norimbergoe, Antonius Koburger</i>, 1474.' This is not new. 'Tis a book of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Lombard" property="schema:name">Pierre Lombard</span>, the Master of Sentences. Is it because it is printed?"</p>
<p>"You have said it," replied Claude, who seemed absorbed in a profound <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Meditation" property="schema:name">meditation</span>, and stood resting, his forefinger bent backward on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Recto_and_verso" property="schema:name">folio</span> which had come from the famous press of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuremberg" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Nuremberg</span>. Then he added these mysterious words: "Alas! alas! small things come at the end of great things; a tooth triumphs over a mass. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nile" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Nile</span> rat kills the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crocodile" property="schema:name">crocodile</span>, the swordfish kills the whale, the book will kill the edifice."</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Curfew" property="schema:name">curfew</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span> sounded at the moment when Master Jacques was repeating to his companion in low tones, his eternal refrain, "He is mad!" To which his companion this time replied, "I believe that he is."</p>
<p>It was the hour when no stranger could remain in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span>. The two visitors withdrew. "Master," said Gossip Tourangeau, as he took leave of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, "I love wise men and great minds, and I hold you in singular esteem. Come to-morrow to the Palace des Tournelles, and inquire for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abbot" property="schema:name">Abbé</span> de Sainte-Martin, of Tours."</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> returned to his chamber dumbfounded, comprehending at last who Gossip Tourangeau was, and recalling that passage of the register of Sainte-Martin, of Tours:—<i>Abbas beati Martini, SCILICET REX FRANCIAE, est canonicus de consuetudine et habet parvam proebendam quam habet sanctus <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venantius_Fortunatus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Venantius</span>, et debet sedere in sede thesaurarii</i>.</p>
<p>It is asserted that after that epoch the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> had frequent conferences with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>., when his majesty came to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, and that Dom Claude's influence quite overshadowed that of Olivier le Daim and Jacques Coictier, who, as was his habit, rudely took the king to task on that account.</p>
<p><a id="link2HCH0023"><!--  H2 anchor --></a></p>
<div class="c4"><br/>

<br/></div>
<h2 id="pgepubid00033">CHAPTER II. THIS WILL KILL THAT.</h2>
<p>Our lady readers will pardon us if we pause for a moment to seek what could have been the thought concealed beneath those enigmatic words of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>: "This will kill that. The book will kill the edifice."</p>
<p>To our mind, this thought had two faces. In the first place, it was a priestly thought. It was the affright of the priest in the presence of a new agent, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Printing_press" property="schema:name">printing press</span>. It was the terror and dazzled amazement of the men of the sanctuary, in the presence of the luminous press of Gutenberg. It was the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pulpit" property="schema:name">pulpit</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manuscript" property="schema:name">manuscript</span> taking the alarm at the printed word: something similar to the stupor of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparrow" property="schema:name">sparrow</span> which should behold the angel Legion unfold his six million wings. It was the cry of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prophet" property="schema:name">prophet</span> who already hears emancipated humanity roaring and swarming; who beholds in the future, intelligence sapping faith, opinion dethroning belief, the world shaking off <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome" property="schema:name">Rome</span>. It was the prognostication of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span> who sees human thought, volatilized by the press, evaporating from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theocracy" property="schema:name">theocratic</span> recipient. It was the terror of the soldier who examines the brazen <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battering_ram" property="schema:name">battering ram</span>, and says:—"The tower will crumble." It signified that one power was about to succeed another power. It meant, "The press will kill the church."</p>
<p>But underlying this thought, the first and most simple one, no doubt, there was in our opinion another, newer one, a corollary of the first, less easy to perceive and more easy to contest, a view as philosophical and belonging no longer to the priest alone but to the savant and the artist. It was a presentiment that human thought, in changing its form, was about to change its mode of expression; that the dominant idea of each generation would no longer be written with the same matter, and in the same manner; that the book of stone, so solid and so durable, was about to make way for the book of paper, more solid and still more durable. In this connection the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>'s vague formula had a second sense. It meant, "Printing will kill architecture."</p>
<p>In fact, from the origin of things down to the fifteenth century of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christianity" property="schema:name">Christian</span> era, inclusive, architecture is the great book of humanity, the principal expression of man in his different stages of development, either as a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span> or as an intelligence.</p>
<p>When the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span> of the first races felt itself overloaded, when the mass of reminiscences of the human race became so heavy and so confused that speech naked and flying, ran the risk of losing them on the way, men transcribed them on the soil in a manner which was at once the most visible, most durable, and most natural. They sealed each tradition beneath a monument.</p>
<p>The first monuments were simple masses of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rock_(geology)" property="schema:name">rock</span>, "which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> had not touched," as <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moses" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Moses</span> says. Architecture began like all writing. It was first an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alphabet" property="schema:name">alphabet</span>. Men planted a stone upright, it was a letter, and each letter was a hieroglyph, and upon each hieroglyph rested a group of ideas, like the capital on the column. This is what the earliest races did everywhere, at the same moment, on the surface of the entire world. We find the "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Menhir" property="schema:name">standing stones</span>" of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celts" property="schema:name">Celts</span> in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia" property="schema:name">Asian</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siberia" property="schema:name">Siberia</span>; in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pathogen-associated_molecular_pattern" property="schema:name">pamp</span>as of America.</p>
<p>Later on, they made words; they placed stone upon stone, they coupled those syllables of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Granite" property="schema:name">granite</span>, and attempted some combinations. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celtic_languages" property="schema:name">Celtic</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dolmen" property="schema:name">dolmen</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cromlech" property="schema:name">cromlech</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Etruscan_civilization" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Etruscan</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tumulus" property="schema:name">tumulus</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hebrew_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Hebrew</span> galgal, are words. Some, especially the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tumulus" property="schema:name">tumulus</span>, are proper names. Sometimes even, when men had a great deal of stone, and a vast plain, they wrote a phrase. The immense pile of Karnac is a complete sentence.</p>
<p>At last they made books. Traditions had brought forth symbols, beneath which they disappeared like the trunk of a tree beneath its foliage; all these symbols in which humanity placed faith continued to grow, to multiply, to intersect, to become more and more complicated; the first monuments no longer sufficed to contain them, they were overflowing in every part; these monuments hardly expressed now the primitive tradition, simple like themselves, naked and prone upon the earth. The symbol felt the need of expansion in the edifice. Then architecture was developed in proportion with human thought; it became a giant with a thousand heads and a thousand arms, and fixed all this floating symbolism in an eternal, visible, palpable form. While <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daedalus" property="schema:name">Daedalus</span>, who is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span>, measured; while <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orpheus" property="schema:name">Orpheus</span>, who is intelligence, sang;—the pillar, which is a letter; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arcade_(architecture)" property="schema:name">arcade</span>, which is a syllable; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyramid" property="schema:name">pyramid</span>, which is a word,—all set in movement at once by a law of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geometry" property="schema:name">geometry</span> and by a law of poetry, grouped themselves, combined, amalgamated, descended, ascended, placed themselves side by side on the soil, ranged themselves in stories in the sky, until they had written under the dictation of the general idea of an epoch, those marvellous books which were also marvellous edifices: the Pagoda of Eklinga, the Rhamseion of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egypt</span>, the Temple of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solomon" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Solomon</span>.</p>
<p>The generating idea, the word, was not only at the foundation of all these edifices, but also in the form. The temple of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solomon" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Solomon</span>, for example, was not alone the binding of the holy book; it was the holy book itself. On each one of its concentric walls, the priests could read the word translated and manifested to the eye, and thus they followed its transformations from sanctuary to sanctuary, until they seized it in its last <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_tabernacle" property="schema:name">tabernacle</span>, under its most concrete form, which still belonged to architecture: the arch. Thus the word was enclosed in an edifice, but its image was upon its envelope, like the human form on the coffin of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mummy" property="schema:name">mummy</span>.</p>
<p>And not only the form of edifices, but the sites selected for them, revealed the thought which they represented, according as the symbol to be expressed was graceful or grave. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece" property="schema:name">Greece</span> crowned her mountains with a temple harmonious to the eye; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/India" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">India</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disembowelment" property="schema:name">disembowelled</span> hers, to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chisel" property="schema:name">chisel</span> therein those monstrous subterranean <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stupa" property="schema:name">pagodas</span>, borne up by gigantic rows of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Granite" property="schema:name">granite</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elephant" property="schema:name">elephants</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, during the first six thousand years of the world, from the most immemorial <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stupa" property="schema:name">pagoda</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/India" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Hindustan</span>, to the cathedral of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cologne_Cathedral" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Cologne</span>, architecture was the great handwriting of the human race. And this is so true, that not only every religious symbol, but every human thought, has its page and its monument in that immense book.</p>
<p>All civilization begins in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theocracy" property="schema:name">theocracy</span> and ends in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democracy" property="schema:name">democracy</span>. This law of liberty following unity is written in architecture. For, let us insist upon this point, masonry must not be thought to be powerful only in erecting the temple and in expressing the myth and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glossary_of_ancient_Roman_religion" property="schema:name">sacerdotal</span> symbolism; in inscribing in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egyptian_hieroglyphs" property="schema:name">hieroglyphs</span> upon its pages of stone the mysterious tables of the law. If it were thus,—as there comes in all human society a moment when the sacred symbol is worn out and becomes obliterated under freedom of thought, when man escapes from the priest, when the excrescence of philosophies and systems devour the face of religion,—architecture could not reproduce this new state of human thought; its leaves, so crowded on the face, would be empty on the back; its work would be mutilated; its book would be incomplete. But no.</p>
<p>Let us take as an example the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span>, where we see more clearly because it is nearer to us. During its first period, while <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theocracy" property="schema:name">theocracy</span> is organizing <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Europe</span>, while the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vatican_City" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Vatican</span> is rallying and reclassing about itself the elements of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome" property="schema:name">Rome</span> made from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome" property="schema:name">Rome</span> which lies in ruins around the Capitol, while <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christianity" property="schema:name">Christianity</span> is seeking all the stages of society amid the rubbish of anterior civilization, and rebuilding with its ruins a new hierarchic universe, the keystone to whose vault is the priest—one first hears a dull echo from that chaos, and then, little by little, one sees, arising from beneath the breath of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christianity" property="schema:name">Christianity</span>, from beneath the hand of the barbarians, from the fragments of the dead <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece" property="schema:name">Greek</span> and Roman architectures, that mysterious <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque architecture</span>, sister of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theocracy" property="schema:name">theocratic</span> masonry of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egypt</span> and of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/India" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">India</span>, inalterable emblem of pure catholicism, unchangeable hieroglyph of the papal unity. All the thought of that day is written, in fact, in this sombre, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque</span> style. One feels everywhere in it authority, unity, the impenetrable, the absolute, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Gregory_VII" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Gregory VII</span>.; always the priest, never the man; everywhere <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caste" property="schema:name">caste</span>, never the people.</p>
<p>But the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crusades" property="schema:name">Crusades</span> arrive. They are a great popular movement, and every great popular movement, whatever may be its cause and object, always sets free the spirit of liberty from its final precipitate. New things spring into life every day. Here opens the stormy period of the Jacqueries, Pragueries, and Leagues. Authority wavers, unity is divided. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feudalism" property="schema:name">Feudalism</span> demands to share with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theocracy" property="schema:name">theocracy</span>, while awaiting the inevitable arrival of the people, who will assume the part of the lion: <i>Quia nominor leo</i>. Seignory pierces through <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sacerdotalism" property="schema:name">sacerdotalism</span>; the commonality, through <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manorialism" property="schema:name">seignory</span>. The face of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Europe</span> is changed. Well! the face of architecture is changed also. Like civilization, it has turned a page, and the new spirit of the time finds her ready to write at its dictation. It returns from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crusades" property="schema:name">crusades</span> with the pointed arch, like the nations with liberty.</p>
<p>Then, while <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Rome</span> is undergoing gradual dismemberment, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque architecture</span> dies. The hieroglyph deserts the cathedral, and betakes itself to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blazon" property="schema:name">blazoning</span> the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keep" property="schema:name">donjon</span> keep, in order to lend prestige to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feudalism" property="schema:name">feudalism</span>. The cathedral itself, that edifice formerly so dogmatic, invaded henceforth by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeoisie</span>, by the community, by liberty, escapes the priest and falls into the power of the artist. The artist builds it after his own fashion. Farewell to mystery, myth, law. Fancy and caprice, welcome. Provided the priest has his basilica and his altar, he has nothing to say. The four walls belong to the artist. The architectural book belongs no longer to the priest, to religion, to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome" property="schema:name">Rome</span>; it is the property of poetry, of imagination, of the people. Hence the rapid and innumerable transformations of that architecture which owns but three centuries, so striking after the stagnant immobility of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque architecture</span>, which owns six or seven. Nevertheless, art marches on with giant strides. Popular genius amid originality accomplish the task which the bishops formerly fulfilled. Each race writes its line upon the book, as it passes; it erases the ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egyptian_hieroglyphs" property="schema:name">hieroglyphs</span> on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book_frontispiece" property="schema:name">frontispieces</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cathedral" property="schema:name">cathedrals</span>, and at the most one only sees <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dogma" property="schema:name">dogma</span> cropping out here and there, beneath the new symbol which it has deposited. The popular drapery hardly permits the religious skeleton to be suspected. One cannot even form an idea of the liberties which the architects then take, even toward the Church. There are capitals knitted of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nun" property="schema:name">nuns</span> and monks, shamelessly coupled, as on the hall of chimney pieces in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Courthouse" property="schema:name">Palais de Justice</span>, in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. There is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Noah's_Ark" property="schema:name">Noah</span>'s <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adventure_game" property="schema:name">adventure</span> carved to the last detail, as under the great portal of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourges" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bourges</span>. There is a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bacchanalia" property="schema:name">bacchanalian</span> monk, with ass's ears and glass in hand, laughing in the face of a whole community, as on the lavatory of the Abbey of Bocherville. There exists at that epoch, for thought written in stone, a privilege exactly comparable to our present liberty of the press. It is the liberty of architecture.</p>
<p>This liberty goes very far. Sometimes a portal, a façade, an entire church, presents a symbolical sense absolutely foreign to worship, or even hostile to the Church. In the thirteenth century, Guillaume de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolas_Flamel" property="schema:name">Nicholas Flamel</span>, in the fifteenth, wrote such seditious pages. Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie was a whole church of the opposition.</p>
<p>Thought was then free only in this manner; hence it never wrote itself out completely except on the books called edifices. Thought, under the form of edifice, could have beheld itself burned in the public square by the hands of the executioner, in its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manuscript" property="schema:name">manuscript</span> form, if it had been sufficiently imprudent to risk itself thus; thought, as the door of a church, would have been a spectator of the punishment of thought as a book. Having thus only this resource, masonry, in order to make its way to the light, flung itself upon it from all quarters. Hence the immense quantity of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cathedral" property="schema:name">cathedrals</span> which have covered Europe—a number so prodigious that one can hardly believe it even after having verified it. All the material forces, all the intellectual forces of society converged towards the same point: architecture. In this manner, under the pretext of building churches to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>, art was developed in its magnificent proportions.</p>
<p>Then whoever was born a poet became an architect. Genius, scattered in the masses, repressed in every quarter under <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feudalism" property="schema:name">feudalism</span> as under a <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Testudo_formation" property="schema:name">testudo</span></i> of brazen <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buckler" property="schema:name">bucklers</span>, finding no issue except in the direction of architecture,—gushed forth through that art, and its Iliads assumed the form of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cathedral" property="schema:name">cathedrals</span>. All other arts obeyed, and placed themselves under the discipline of architecture. They were the workmen of the great work. The architect, the poet, the master, summed up in his person the sculpture which carved his façades, painting which illuminated his windows, music which set his bells to pealing, and breathed into his organs. There was nothing down to poor poetry,—properly speaking, that which persisted in vegetating in manuscripts,—which was not forced, in order to make something of itself, to come and frame itself in the edifice in the shape of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hymn" property="schema:name">hymn</span> or of prose; the same part, after all, which the tragedies of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aeschylus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">AEschylus</span> had played in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clergy" property="schema:name">sacerdotal</span> festivals of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece" property="schema:name">Greece</span>; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book_of_Genesis" property="schema:name">Genesis</span>, in the temple of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solomon" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Solomon</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, down to the time of Gutenberg, architecture is the principal writing, the universal writing. In that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Granite" property="schema:name">granite</span> book, begun by the Orient, continued by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece" property="schema:name">Greek</span> and Roman antiquity, the Mid<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/C0_and_C1_control_codes" property="schema:name">dle</span> Ages wrote the last page. Moreover, this phenomenon of an architecture of the people following an architecture of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caste" property="schema:name">caste</span>, which we have just been observing in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span>, is reproduced with every analogous movement in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intelligence" property="schema:name">human intelligence</span> at the other great epochs of history. Thus, in order to enunciate here only summarily, a law which it would require volumes to develop: in the high Orient, the cradle of primitive times, after <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindu" property="schema:name">Hindoo</span> architecture came <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Phoenician</span> architecture, that opulent mother of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semitic_languages" property="schema:name">Arabian</span> architecture; in antiquity, after <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egyptian</span> architecture, of which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Etruscan_civilization" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Etruscan</span> style and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyclopean_masonry" property="schema:name">cyclopean</span> monuments are but one variety, came <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece" property="schema:name">Greek</span> architecture (of which the Roman style is only a continuation), <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Overprint" property="schema:name">surcharged</span> with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carthage" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Carthaginian</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dome" property="schema:name">dome</span>; in modern times, after <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque architecture</span> came <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic architecture</span>. And by separating there three series into their component parts, we shall find in the three eldest sisters, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindu" property="schema:name">Hindoo</span> architecture, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egyptian</span> architecture, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque architecture</span>, the same symbol; that is to say, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theocracy" property="schema:name">theocracy</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caste" property="schema:name">caste</span>, unity, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dogma" property="schema:name">dogma</span>, myth, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>: and for the three younger sisters, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Phoenician</span> architecture, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greek_architecture" property="schema:name">Greek architecture</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic architecture</span>, whatever, nevertheless, may be the diversity of form inherent in their nature, the same signification also; that is to say, liberty, the people, man.</p>
<p>In the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindu" property="schema:name">Hindu</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egyptian</span>, or <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque architecture</span>, one feels the priest, nothing but the priest, whether he calls himself <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brahmin" property="schema:name">Brahmin</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magi" property="schema:name">Magian</span>, or <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span>. It is not the same in the architectures of the people. They are richer and less sacred. In the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Phoenician</span>, one feels the merchant; in the Greek, the republican; in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span>, the citizen.</p>
<p>The general characteristics of all <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theocracy" property="schema:name">theocratic</span> architecture are immutability, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horror_fiction" property="schema:name">horror</span> of progress, the preservation of traditional lines, the consecration of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Primitive_data_type" property="schema:name">primitive types</span>, the constant bending of all the forms of men and of nature to the incomprehensible caprices of the symbol. These are dark books, which the initiated alone understand how to decipher. Moreover, every form, every deformity even, has there a sense which renders it inviolable. Do not ask of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindu" property="schema:name">Hindoo</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egyptian</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque</span> masonry to reform their design, or to improve their statuary. Every attempt at perfecting is an impiety to them. In these architectures it seems as though the rigidity of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dogma" property="schema:name">dogma</span> had spread over the stone like a sort of second <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petrifaction" property="schema:name">petrifaction</span>. The general characteristics of popular masonry, on the contrary, are progress, originality, opulence, perpetual movement. They are already sufficiently detached from religion to think of their beauty, to take care of it, to correct without relaxation their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parure" property="schema:name">parure</span> of statues or <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabesque_(Islamic_art)" property="schema:name">arabesques</span>. They are of the age. They have something human, which they mingle incessantly with the divine symbol under which they still produce. Hence, edifices comprehensible to every <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, to every intelligence, to every imagination, symbolical still, but as easy to understand as nature. Between theocratic architecture and this there is the difference that lies between a sacred language and a vulgar language, between <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egyptian_hieroglyphs" property="schema:name">hieroglyphics</span> and art, between <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solomon" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Solomon</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phidias" property="schema:name">Phidias</span>.</p>
<p>If the reader will sum up what we have hitherto briefly, very briefly, indicated, neglecting a thousand proofs and also a thousand objections of detail, he will be led to this: that architecture was, down to the fifteenth century, the chief register of humanity; that in that interval not a thought which is in any degree complicated made its appearance in the world, which has not been worked into an edifice; that every popular idea, and every religious law, has had its monumental records; that the human race has, in short, had no important thought which it has not written in stone. And why? Because every thought, either philosophical or religious, is interested in perpetuating itself; because the idea which has moved one generation wishes to move others also, and leave a trace. Now, what a precarious immortality is that of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manuscript" property="schema:name">manuscript</span>! How much more solid, durable, unyielding, is a book of stone! In order to destroy the written word, a torch and a Turk are sufficient. To demolish the constructed word, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Social_revolution" property="schema:name">social revolution</span>, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earth" property="schema:name">terrestrial</span> revolution are required. The barbarians passed over the Coliseum; the deluge, perhaps, passed over the Pyramids.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth century everything changes.</p>
<p>Human thought discovers a mode of perpetuating itself, not only more durable and more resisting than architecture, but still more simple and easy. Architecture is dethroned. Gutenberg's letters of lead are about to supersede <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orpheus" property="schema:name">Orpheus</span>'s letters of stone.</p></body></html>
