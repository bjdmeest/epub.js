<p>One evening when the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Curfew" property="schema:name">curfew</span> was sounding from all the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">belfries</span> in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, the sergeants of the watch might have observed, had it been granted to them to enter the formidable Court of Miracles, that more tumult than usual was in progress in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span>' <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tavern" property="schema:name">tavern</span>, that more drinking was being done, and louder swearing. Outside in the Place, there, were many groups conversing in low tones, as when some great plan is being framed, and here and there a knave crouching down engaged in sharpening a villanous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> blade on a paving-stone.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tavern" property="schema:name">tavern</span> itself, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span> and gaming offered such a powerful diversion to the ideas which occupied the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span>' lair that evening, that it would have been difficult to divine from the remarks of the drinkers, what was the matter in hand. They merely wore a gayer air than was their wont, and some weapon could be seen glittering between the legs of each of them,—a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sickle" property="schema:name">sickle</span>, an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Axe" property="schema:name">axe</span>, a big two-edged sword or the hook of an old hackbut.</p>
<p>The room, circular in form, was very spacious; but the tables were so thickly set and the drinkers so numerous, that all that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tavern" property="schema:name">tavern</span> contained, men, women, benches, beer-jugs, all that were drinking, all that were sleeping, all that were playing, the well, the lame, seemed piled up pell-mell, with as much order and harmony as a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory_management" property="schema:name">heap</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oyster" property="schema:name">oyster</span> shells. There were a few <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tallow" property="schema:name">tallow</span> dips lighted on the tables; but the real luminary of this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tavern" property="schema:name">tavern</span>, that which played the part in this dram-shop of the chandelier of an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera" property="schema:name">opera</span> house, was the fire. This cellar was so damp that the fire was never allowed to go out, even in midsummer; an immense chimney with a sculptured mantel, all bristling with heavy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cast_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andiron" property="schema:name">andirons</span> and cooking utensils, with one of those huge fires of mixed wood and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peat" property="schema:name">peat</span> which at night, in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Village" property="schema:name">village</span> streets make the reflection of forge windows stand out so <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> on the opposite walls. A big <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">dog</span> gravely seated in the ashes was turning a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rotisserie" property="schema:name">spit</span> loaded with meat before the coals.</p>
<p>Great as was the confusion, after the first glance one could distinguish in that multitude, three principal groups which thronged around three personages already known to the reader. One of these personages, fantastically accoutred in many an oriental rag, was Mathias Hungadi Spicali, Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egypt</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bohemia</span>. The knave was seated on a table with his legs crossed, and in a loud voice was bestowing his knowledge of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span>, both black and white, on many a gaping face which surrounded him. Another rabble pressed close around our old friend, the valiant King of Thunes, armed to the teeth. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span>, with a very serious air and in a low voice, was regulating the distribution of an enormous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barrel" property="schema:name">cask</span> of arms, which stood wide open in front of him and from whence poured out in profusion, axes, swords, bassinets, coats of mail, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basket-hilted_sword" property="schema:name">broadswords</span>, lance-heads, arrows, and viretons,* like apples and grapes from a horn of plenty. Every one took something from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barrel" property="schema:name">cask</span>, one a morion, another a long, straight sword, another a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dagger" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">dagger</span> with a cross—shaped <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sword" property="schema:name">hilt</span>. The very children were arming themselves, and there were even cripples in bowls who, in armor and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cuirass" property="schema:name">cuirass</span>, made their way between the legs of the drinkers, like great <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beetle" property="schema:name">beetles</span>.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  An arrow with a pyramidal head of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copper" property="schema:name">copper</span> spiral<br/>wings, by which a rotatory motion was communicated.<br/></div>
<p>Finally, a third audience, the most noisy, the most jovial, and the most numerous, encumbered benches and tables, in the midst of which harangued and swore a flute-like voice, which escaped from beneath a heavy armor, complete from casque to spurs. The individual who had thus screwed a whole outfit upon his body, was so hidden by his warlike accoutrements that nothing was to be seen of his person save an impertinent, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span>, snub nose, a rosy mouth, and bold eyes. His belt was full of daggers and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poignard" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">poniards</span>, a huge sword on his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hip" property="schema:name">hip</span>, a rusted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crossbow" property="schema:name">cross-bow</span> at his left, and a vast <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Libation" property="schema:name">jug</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span> in front of him, without reckoning on his right, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Obesity" property="schema:name">fat</span> wench with her bosom uncovered. All mouths around him were laughing, cursing, and drinking.</p>
<p>Add twenty secondary groups, the waiters, male and female, running with jugs on their heads, gamblers <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Squat_(exercise)" property="schema:name">squatting</span> over <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Terrain_awareness_and_warning_system" property="schema:name">taws</span>, merelles,* <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dice" property="schema:name">dice</span>, vachettes, the ardent game of tringlet, quarrels in one corner, kisses in another, and the reader will have some idea of this whole picture, over which flickered the light of a great, flaming fire, which made a thousand huge and grotesque shadows dance over the walls of the drinking shop.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  A game played on a checker-board containing three concentric<br/>sets of squares, with small stones. The game consisted in getting three<br/>stones in a row.<br/></div>
<p>As for the noise, it was like the inside of a bell at full <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ring_of_bells" property="schema:name">peal</span>.</p>
<p>The dripping-pan, where crackled a rain of grease, filled with its continual <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sputtering" property="schema:name">sputtering</span> the intervals of these thousand dialogues, which intermingled from one end of the apartment to the other.</p>
<p>In the midst of this uproar, at the extremity of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tavern" property="schema:name">tavern</span>, on the bench inside the chimney, sat a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span> meditating with his feet in the ashes and his eyes on the brands. It was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p>"Be quick! make haste, arm yourselves! we set out on the march in an hour!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span> to his thieves.</p>
<p>A wench was humming,—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">         "<i>Bonsoir mon père et ma mere,<br/>         Les derniers couvrent le feu</i>."*<br/></div>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     * Good night, father and mother, the last cover up the fire.<br/></div>
<p>Two card players were disputing,—</p>
<p>"Knave!" cried the reddest faced of the two, shaking his fist at the other; "I'll mark you with the club. You can take the place of Mistigri in the pack of cards of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monsignor" property="schema:name">monseigneur</span> the king."</p>
<p>"Ugh!" roared a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Normans" property="schema:name">Norman</span>, recognizable by his nasal accent; "we are packed in here like the saints of Caillouville!"</p>
<p>"My sons," the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egypt</span> was saying to his audience, in a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Falsetto" property="schema:name">falsetto</span> voice, "sorceresses in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span> go to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witches'_Sabbath" property="schema:name">witches' sabbath</span> without broomsticks, or grease, or steed, merely by means of some <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span> words. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witches</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Italy</span> always have a buck waiting for them at their door. All are bound to go out through the chimney."</p>
<p>The voice of the young scamp armed from head to foot, dominated the uproar.</p>
<p>"Hurrah! hurrah!" he was shouting. "My first day in armor! Outcast! I am an outcast. Give me something to drink. My friends, my name is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Jehan Frollo</span> du Moulin, and I am a gentleman. My opinion is that if <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> were a <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gendarmerie" property="schema:name">gendarme</span></i>, he would turn robber. Brothers, we are about to set out on a fine expedition. Lay siege to the church, burst in the doors, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drag_(clothing)" property="schema:name">drag</span> out the beautiful girl, save her from the judges, save her from the priests, dismantle the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span>, burn the bishop in his palace—all this we will do in less time than it takes for a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burgomaster" property="schema:name">burgomaster</span> to eat a spoonful of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soup" property="schema:name">soup</span>. Our cause is just, we will plunder Notre-Dame and that will be the end of it. We will hang <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. Do you know <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, ladies? Have you seen him make himself <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathless_(1960_film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">breathless</span> on the big bell on a grand <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pentecost" property="schema:name">Pentecost</span> festival! <i>Corne du Père</i>! 'tis very fine! One would say he was a devil mounted on a man. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Listen_(Beyoncé_Knowles_song)" property="schema:name">Listen</span> to me, my friends; I am a vagabond to the bottom of my heart, I am a member of the slang thief gang in my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, I was born an independent thief. I have been rich, and I have devoured all my property. My mother wanted to make an officer of me; my father, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Subdeacon" property="schema:name">sub-deacon</span>; my aunt, a councillor of inquests; my grandmother, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prothonotary" property="schema:name">prothonotary</span> to the king; my great aunt, a treasurer of the short robe,—and I have made myself an outcast. I said this to my father, who <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saliva" property="schema:name">spit</span> his curse in my face; to my mother, who set to weeping and chattering, poor old lady, like yonder fagot on the and-irons. Long live mirth! I am a real <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bicêtre_Hospital" property="schema:name">Bicêtre</span>. Waitress, my dear, more <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span>. I have still the wherewithal to pay. I want no more Surène <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span>. It distresses my throat. I'd as lief, <i>corboeuf</i>! gargle my throat with a basket."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rabble applauded with shouts of laughter; and seeing that the tumult was increasing around him, the scholar cried,—.</p>
<p>"Oh! what a fine noise! <i>Populi debacchantis populosa debacchatio</i>!" Then he began to sing, his eye swimming in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/MDMA" property="schema:name">ecstasy</span>, in the tone of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canon_(music)" property="schema:name">canon</span> intoning <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vespers" property="schema:name">vespers</span>, <i>quae cantica! quae organa! quae cantilenoe! quae meloclioe hic <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sine" property="schema:name">sine</span> fine decantantur! Sonant melliflua hymnorum organa, suavissima angelorum melodia, cantica canticorum mira</i>! He broke off: "Tavern-keeper of the devil, give me some supper!"</p>
<p>There was a moment of partial silence, during which the sharp voice of the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egypt</span> rose, as he gave instructions to his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bohemians</span>.</p>
<p>"The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Weasel" property="schema:name">weasel</span> is called Adrune; the fox, Blue-foot, or the Racer of the Woods; the wolf, Gray-foot, or Gold-foot; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bear" property="schema:name">bear</span> the Old Man, or Grandfather. The cap of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gnome" property="schema:name">gnome</span> confers invisibility, and causes one to behold invisible things. Every <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toad" property="schema:name">toad</span> that is baptized must be clad in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red_deer" property="schema:name">red</span> or <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Velvet_(song)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">black velvet</span>, a bell on its neck, a bell on its feet. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Godfather" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">The godfather</span> holds its head, the godmother its hinder parts. 'Tis the demon Sidragasum who hath the power to make wenches dance stark naked."</p>
<p>"By the mass!" interrupted Jehan, "I should like to be the demon Sidragasum."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span> continued to arm themselves and whisper at the other end of the dram-shop.</p>
<p>"That poor Esmeralda!" said a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span>. "She is our sister. She must be taken away from there."</p>
<p>"Is she still at Notre-Dame?" went on a merchant with the appearance of a Jew.</p>
<p>"Yes, pardieu!"</p>
<p>"Well! comrades!" exclaimed the merchant, "to Notre-Dame! So much the better, since there are in the chapel of Saints Féréol and Ferrution two statues, the one of John the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baptism" property="schema:name">Baptist</span>, the other of Saint-Antoine, of solid gold, weighing together seven marks of gold and fifteen estellins; and the pedestals are of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silver-gilt" property="schema:name">silver-gilt</span>, of seventeen marks, five ounces. I know that; I am a goldsmith."</p>
<p>Here they served Jehan with his supper. As he threw himself back on the bosom of the wench beside him, he exclaimed,—</p>
<p>"By Saint Voult-de-Lucques, whom people call Saint Goguelu, I am perfectly happy. I have before me a fool who gazes at me with the smooth face of an archduke. Here is one on my left whose teeth are so long that they hide his chin. And then, I am like the Marshal de Gié at the siege of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pontoise" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Pontoise</span>, I have my right resting on a hillock. <i>Ventre-Mahom</i>! Comrade! you have the air of a merchant of tennis-balls; and you come and sit yourself beside me! I am a nobleman, my friend! Trade is incompatible with nobility. Get out of that! Hola hé! You others, don't fight! What, Baptiste Croque-Oison, you who have such a fine nose are going to risk it against the big fists of that lout! Fool! <i>Non cuiquam <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geodetic_datum" property="schema:name">datum</span> est habere <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nasum" property="schema:name">nasum</span></i>—not every one is favored with a nose. You are really divine, Jacqueline Ronge-Oreille! 'tis a pity that you have no hair! Holà! my name is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Jehan Frollo</span>, and my brother is an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>. May the devil fly off with him! All that I tell you is the truth. In turning vagabond, I have gladly renounced the half of a house situated in paradise, which my brother had promised me. <i>Dimidiam domum in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_Comedy" property="schema:name">paradiso</span></i>.

<p>In the meantime, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span> had finished the distribution of arms. He approached <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, who appeared to be plunged in a profound revery, with his feet on an andiron.</p>
<p>"Friend Pierre," said the King of Thunes, "what the devil are you thinking about?"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> turned to him with a melancholy smile.</p>
<p>"I love the fire, my dear lord. Not for the trivial reason that fire warms the feet or cooks our <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soup" property="schema:name">soup</span>, but because it has sparks. Sometimes I pass whole hours in watching the sparks. I discover a thousand things in those stars which are sprinkled over the black background of the hearth. Those stars are also worlds."</p>
<p>"Thunder, if I understand you!" said the outcast. "Do you know what o'clock it is?"</p>
<p>"I do not know," replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span> approached the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egypt</span>.</p>
<p>"Comrade Mathias, the time we have chosen is not a good one.

<p>"Another reason for snatching our sister from his claws," replied the old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemian" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span>.</p>
<p>"You speak like a man, Mathias," said the King of Thunes. "Moreover, we will act promptly. No resistance is to be feared in the church. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canon_law" property="schema:name">canons</span> are <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hare" property="schema:name">hares</span>, and we are in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span>.

<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frédéric_Chopin" property="schema:name">Chopin</span> quitted the dram-shop.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jehan was shouting in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"I eat, I drink, I am drunk, I am <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>! Eh! Pierre, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_animals_of_the_Edge_Chronicles" property="schema:name">Slaughterer</span>, if you look at me like that again, I'll fillip the dust off your nose for you."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, torn from his meditations, began to watch the wild and noisy scene which surrounded him, muttering between his teeth: "<i>Luxuriosa res vinum et tumultuosa ebrietas</i>. Alas! what good reason I have not to drink, and how excellently spoke <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Benoît,_Réunion" property="schema:name">Saint-Benoit</span>: '<i>Vinum apostatare <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Whitworth,_Lancashire" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">facit</span> etiam sapientes!</i>'"</p>
<p>At that moment, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span> returned and shouted in a voice of thunder: "Midnight!"</p>
<p>At this word, which produced the effect of the call to boot and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saddle" property="schema:name">saddle</span> on a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regiment" property="schema:name">regiment</span> at a halt, all the outcasts, men, women, children, rushed in a mass from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tavern" property="schema:name">tavern</span>, with great noise of arms and old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> implements.</p>
<p>The moon was obscured.</p>
<p>The Cour des Miracles was entirely dark. There was not a single light. One could make out there a throng of men and women conversing in low tones. They could be heard buzzing, and a gleam of all sorts of weapons was visible in the darkness. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span> mounted a large stone.</p>
<p>"To your ranks, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argot" property="schema:name">Argot</span>!"* he cried. "Fall into line, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egypt</span>! Form ranks, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galilee" property="schema:name">Galilee</span>!"</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  Men of the brotherhood of slang: thieves.<br/></div>
<p>A movement began in the darkness. The immense multitude appeared to form in a column. After a few minutes, the King of Thunes raised his voice once more,—</p>
<p>"Now, silence to march through <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>! The password is, 'Little sword in pocket!' The torches will not be lighted till we reach Notre-Dame! Forward, march!"</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, the cavaliers of the watch fled in terror before a long procession of black and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span> men which was descending towards the Pont an Change, through the tortuous streets which pierce the close-built neighborhood of the markets in every direction.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00068">CHAPTER IV. AN AWKWARD FRIEND.</h2>
<p>That night, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> did not sleep. He had just made his last round of the church. He had not noticed, that at the moment when he was closing the doors, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> had passed close to him and betrayed some displeasure on seeing him bolting and barring with care the enormous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wrought_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> locks which gave to their large leaves the solidity of a wall. Dom Claude's air was even more preoccupied than usual. Moreover, since the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nocturnality" property="schema:name">nocturnal</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adventure" property="schema:name">adventure</span> in the cell, he had constantly abused <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, but in vain did he ill treat, and even beat him occasionally, nothing disturbed the submission, patience, the devoted resignation of the faithful <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span>. He endured everything on the part of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, insults, threats, blows, without murmuring a complaint. At the most, he gazed uneasily after Dom Claude when the latter ascended the staircase of the tower; but the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> had abstained from presenting himself again before the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s eyes.</p>
<p>On that night, accordingly, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, after having cast a glance at his poor bells which he so neglected now, Jacqueline, Marie, and Thibauld, mounted to the summit of the Northern tower, and there setting his dark <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Pokémon_(152–201)" property="schema:name">lanturn</span>, well closed, upon the leads, he began to gaze at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. The night, as we have already said, was very dark. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> which, so to speak was not lighted at that epoch, presented to the eye a confused collection of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Mass" property="schema:name">black masses</span>, cut here and there by the whitish curve of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> no longer saw any light with the exception of one window in a distant edifice, whose vague and sombre profile was outlined well above the roofs, in the direction of the Porte Sainte-Antoine. There also, there was some one awake.</p>
<p>As the only eye of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> peered into that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Observable_universe" property="schema:name">horizon</span> of mist and night, he felt within him an inexpressible uneasiness. For several days he had been upon his guard. He had perceived men of sinister <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yao_people" property="schema:name">mien</span>, who never took their eyes from the young girl's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Psychiatric_hospital" property="schema:name">asylum</span>, prowling constantly about the church. He fancied that some plot might be in process of formation against the unhappy refugee. He imagined that there existed a popular hatred against her, as against himself, and that it was very possible that something might happen soon. Hence he remained upon his tower on the watch, "dreaming in his dream-place," as <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/François_Rabelais" property="schema:name">Rabelais</span> says, with his eye directed alternately on the cell and on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, keeping faithful guard, like a good <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">dog</span>, with a thousand suspicions in his mind.</p>
<p>All at once, while he was scrutinizing the great city with that eye which nature, by a sort of compensation, had made so piercing that it could almost supply the other organs which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> lacked, it seemed to him that there was something singular about the Quay de la Vieille-Pelleterie, that there was a movement at that point, that the line of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parapet" property="schema:name">parapet</span>, standing out blackly against the whiteness of the water was not straight and tranquil, like that of the other quays, but that it undulated to the eye, like the waves of a river, or like the heads of a crowd in motion.</p>
<p>This struck him as strange. He redoubled his attention. The movement seemed to be advancing towards the City. There was no light. It lasted for some time on the quay; then it gradually ceased, as though that which was passing were entering the interior of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Island" property="schema:name">island</span>; then it stopped altogether, and the line of the quay became straight and motionless again.</p>
<p>At the moment when <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was lost in conjectures, it seemed to him that the movement had re-appeared in the Rue du Parvis, which is prolonged into the city perpendicularly to the façade of Notre-Dame. At length, dense as was the darkness, he beheld the head of a column <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Debouch" property="schema:name">debouch</span> from that street, and in an instant a crowd—of which nothing could be distinguished in the gloom except that it was a crowd—spread over the Place.</p>
<p>This spectacle had a terror of its own. It is probable that this singular procession, which seemed so desirous of concealing itself under profound darkness, maintained a silence no less profound. Nevertheless, some noise must have escaped it, were it only a trampling. But this noise did not even reach our deaf man, and this great multitude, of which he saw hardly anything, and of which he heard nothing, though it was marching and moving so near him, produced upon him the effect of a rabble of dead men, mute, impalpable, lost in a smoke. It seemed to him, that he beheld advancing towards him a fog of men, and that he saw shadows moving in the shadow.</p>
<p>Then his fears returned to him, the idea of an attempt against the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> presented itself once more to his mind. He was conscious, in a confused way, that a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/2007–08_Kenyan_crisis" property="schema:name">violent crisis</span> was approaching. At that critical moment he took counsel with himself, with better and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prompter" property="schema:name">prompter</span> reasoning than one would have expected from so badly organized a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brain" property="schema:name">brain</span>. Ought he to awaken the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>? to make her escape? Whither? The streets were invested, the church backed on the river. No boat, no issue!—There was but one thing to be done; to allow himself to be killed on the threshold of Notre-Dame, to resist at least until succor arrived, if it should arrive, and not to trouble <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span>'s sleep. This resolution once taken, he set to examining the enemy with more tranquillity.</p>
<p>The throng seemed to increase every moment in the church square. Only, he presumed that it must be making very little noise, since the windows on the Place remained closed. All at once, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire" property="schema:name">flame</span> flashed up, and in an instant seven or eight lighted torches passed over the heads of the crowd, shaking their tufts of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire" property="schema:name">flame</span> in the deep shade. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> then beheld distinctly surging in the Par<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vis_(island)" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">vis</span> a frightful herd of men and women in rags, armed with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythe" property="schema:name">scythes</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pike_(weapon)" property="schema:name">pikes</span>, billhooks and partisans, whose thousand points glittered. Here and there black pitchforks formed horns to the hideous faces. He vaguely recalled this populace, and thought that he recognized all the heads who had saluted him as <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span> of the Fools some months previously. One man who held a torch in one hand and a club in the other, mounted a stone post and seemed to be haranguing them. At the same time the strange army executed several evolutions, as though it were taking up its post around the church. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> picked up his lantern and descended to the platform between the towers, in order to get a nearer view, and to spy out a means of defence.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span>, on arriving in front of the lofty portal of Notre-Dame had, in fact, ranged his troops in order of battle. Although he expected no resistance, he wished, like a prudent general, to preserve an order which would permit him to face, at need, a sudden attack of the watch or the police. He had accordingly stationed his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brigade" property="schema:name">brigade</span> in such a manner that, viewed from above and from a distance, one would have pronounced it the Roman <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triangle" property="schema:name">triangle</span> of the battle of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Cape_Ecnomus" typeof="schema:Event" property="schema:name">Ecnomus</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wild_boar" property="schema:name">boar</span>'s head of Alexander or the famous wedge of Gustavus Adolphus. The base of this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triangle" property="schema:name">triangle</span> rested on the back of the Place in such a manner as to bar the entrance of the Rue du Parvis; one of its sides faced <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hôtel-Dieu_de_Paris" property="schema:name">Hôtel-Dieu</span>, the other the Rue Saint-Pierre-aux-Boeufs. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hectare" property="schema:name">ha</span>d placed himself at the apex with the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egypt</span>, our friend Jehan, and the most daring of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scavenger" property="schema:name">scavengers</span>.</p>
<p>An enterprise like that which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span> were now undertaking against Notre-Dame was not a very rare thing in the cities of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span>. What we now call the "police" did not exist then. In populous cities, especially in capitals, there existed no single, central, regulating power. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feudalism" property="schema:name">Feudalism</span> had constructed these great communities in a singular manner. A city was an assembly of a thousand <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fee_(feudal_tenure)" property="schema:name">seigneuries</span>, which divided it into compartments of all shapes and sizes. Hence, a thousand conflicting establishments of police; that is to say, no police at all. In <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, for example, independently of the hundred and forty-one lords who laid claim to a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manorialism" property="schema:name">manor</span>, there were five and twenty who laid claim to a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manorialism" property="schema:name">manor</span> and to administering justice, from the Bishop of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, who had five hundred streets, to the Prior of Notre-Dame des Champs, who had four. All these <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feudalism" property="schema:name">feudal</span> justices recognized the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suzerainty" property="schema:name">suzerain</span> authority of the king only in name. All possessed the right of control over the roads. All were at home. Louis XI., that indefatigable worker, who so largely began the demolition of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feudalism" property="schema:name">feudal</span> edifice, continued by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_Richelieu" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Richelieu</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XIV</span>. for the profit of royalty, and finished by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Honoré_Gabriel_Riqueti,_comte_de_Mirabeau" property="schema:name">Mirabeau</span> for the benefit of the people,—<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. had certainly made an effort to break this network of seignories which covered <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, by throwing violently across them all two or three troops of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genus" property="schema:name">genera</span>l police. Thus, in 1465, an order to the inhabitants to light candles in their windows at nightfall, and to shut up their dogs under penalty of death; in the same year, an order to close the streets in the evening with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wrought_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> chains, and a prohibition to wear daggers or weapons of offence in the streets at night. But in a very short time, all these efforts at communal legislation fell into <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abeyance" property="schema:name">abeyance</span>. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> permitted the wind to blow out their candles in the windows, and their dogs to stray; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wrought_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> chains were stretched only in a state of siege; the prohibition to wear daggers wrought no other changes than from the name of the Rue Coupe-Gueule to the name of the Rue-Coupe-Gorge* which is an evident progress. The old scaffolding of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feudalism" property="schema:name">feudal</span> jurisdictions remained standing; an immense aggregation of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiwick" property="schema:name">bailiwicks</span> and seignories crossing each other all over the city, interfering with each other, entangled in one another, enmeshing each other, trespassing on each other; a useless thicket of watches, sub-watches and counter-watches, over which, with armed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_Army" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">force</span>, passed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brigandage" property="schema:name">brigandage</span>, rapine, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sedition" property="schema:name">sedition</span>. Hence, in this disorder, deeds of violence on the part of the populace directed against a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace" property="schema:name">palace</span>, a hotel, or house in the most thickly populated quarters, were not unheard-of occurrences. In the majority of such cases, the neighbors did not <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Meddle" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">meddle</span> with the matter unless the pillaging extended to themselves. They stopped up their ears to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musket" property="schema:name">musket</span> shots, closed their shutters, barricaded their doors, allowed the matter to be concluded with or without the watch, and the next day it was said in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, "Etienne Barbette was broken open last night. The Marshal de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clermont-Ferrand" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Clermont</span> was seized last night, etc." Hence, not only the royal habitations, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louvre_Palace" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Louvre</span>, the Palace, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution" property="schema:name">Bastille</span>, the Tournelles, but simply seignorial residences, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hôtel_du_Petit-Bourbon" property="schema:name">Petit-Bourbon</span>, the Hôtel de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Sens" property="schema:name">Sens</span>, the Hôtel d' <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angoulême" property="schema:name">Angoulême</span>, etc., had <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battlement" property="schema:name">battlements</span> on their walls, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Machicolation" property="schema:name">machicolations</span> over their doors. Churches were guarded by their sanctity. Some, among the number Notre-Dame, were fortified. The Abbey of Saint-German-des-Pres was castellated like a baronial mansion, and more <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brass" property="schema:name">brass</span> expended about it in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bombardment" property="schema:name">bombards</span> than in bells. Its fortress was still to be seen in 1610. To-day, barely its church remains.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  Cut-throat.  Coupe-gueule being the vulgar word for cut-weazand.<br/></div>
<p>Let us return to Notre-Dame.</p>
<p>When the first arrangements were completed, and we must say, to the honor of vagabond discipline, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>'s orders were executed in silence, and with admirable precision, the worthy chief of the band, mounted on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parapet" property="schema:name">parapet</span> of the church square, and raised his hoarse and surly voice, turning towards Notre-Dame, and brandishing his torch whose light, tossed by the wind, and veiled every moment by its own smoke, made the reddish façade of the church appear and disappear before the eye.</p>
<p>"To you, Louis de Beaumont, bishop of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, counsellor in the Court of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parliament_of_England" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">Parliament</span>, I, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span>, king of Thu<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nintendo_Entertainment_System" property="schema:name">nes</span>, grand Coësre, prince of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argot" property="schema:name">Argot</span>, bishop of fools, I say: Our sister, falsely condemned for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span>, hath taken refuge in your church, you owe her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sanctuary" property="schema:name">asylum</span> and safety. Now the Court of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parliament_of_England" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">Parliament</span> wishes to seize her once more there, and you consent to it; so that she would be hanged to-morrow in the Grève, if <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> and the outcasts were not here. If your church is sacred, so is our sister; if our sister is not sacred, neither is your church. That is why we call upon you to return the girl if you wish to save your church, or we will take possession of the girl again and pillage the church, which will be a good thing. In token of which I here plant my banner, and may <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> preserve you, bishop of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> could not, unfortunately, hear these words uttered with a sort of sombre and savage majesty. A vagabond presented his banner to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>, who planted it solemnly between two paving-stones. It was a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pitchfork" property="schema:name">pitchfork</span> from whose points hung a bleeding quarter of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scavenger" property="schema:name">carrion</span> meat.</p>
<p>That done, the King of Thunes turned round and cast his eyes over his army, a fierce multitude whose glances flashed almost equally with their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pike_(weapon)" property="schema:name">pikes</span>. After a momentary pause,—"Forward, my Sons!" he cried; "to work, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lock_(device)" property="schema:name">locksmiths</span>!"</p>
<p>Thirty bold men, square shouldered, and with pick-lock faces, stepped from the ranks, with hammers, pincers, and bars of iron on their shoulders. They betook themselves to the principal door of the church, ascended the steps, and were soon to be seen <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Squatting" property="schema:name">squatting</span> under the arch, working at the door with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claw" property="schema:name">pincers</span> and levers; a throng of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span> followed them to help or look on. The eleven steps before the portal were covered with them.</p>
<p>But the door stood firm. "The devil! 'tis hard and obstinate!" said one. "It is old, and its gristles have become bony," said another. "Courage, comrades!" resumed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>. "I wager my head against a dipper that you will have opened the door, rescued the girl, and despoiled the chief altar before a single <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beadle" property="schema:name">beadle</span> is awake. Stay! I think I hear the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lock_(device)" property="schema:name">lock</span> breaking up."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span> was interrupted by a frightful uproar which re-sounded behind him at that moment. He wheeled round. An enormous beam had just fallen from above; it had crushed a dozen <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span> on the pavement with the sound of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cannon" property="schema:name">cannon</span>, breaking in addition, legs here and there in the crowd of beggars, who sprang aside with cries of terror. In a twinkling, the narrow precincts of the church <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parvise" property="schema:name">parvis</span> were cleared. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lock_(device)" property="schema:name">locksmiths</span>, although protected by the deep vaults of the portal, abandoned the door and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span> himself retired to a respectful distance from the church.</p>
<p>"I had a narrow escape!" cried Jehan. "I felt the wind, of it, <i>tête-de-boeuf</i>! but Pierre the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_animals_of_the_Edge_Chronicles" property="schema:name">Slaughterer</span> is slaughtered!"</p>
<p>It is impossible to describe the astonishment mingled with fright which fell upon the ruffians in company with this beam.</p>
<p>They remained for several minutes with their eyes in the air, more dismayed by that piece of wood than by the king's twenty thousand archers.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Devil" property="schema:name">Satan</span>!" muttered the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egypt</span>, "this smacks of magic!"</p>
<p>"'Tis the moon which threw this log at us," said Andry the Red.</p>
<p>"Call the moon the friend of the Virgin, after that!" went on Francois Chanteprune.</p>
<p>"A thousand popes!" exclaimed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>, "you are all fools!" But he did not know how to explain the fall of the beam.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, nothing could be distinguished on the façade, to whose summit the light of the torches did not reach. The heavy beam lay in the middle of the enclosure, and groans were heard from the poor wretches who had received its first shock, and who had been almost cut in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/TWAIN" property="schema:name">twain</span>, on the angle of the stone steps.</p>
<p>The King of Thunes, his first amazement passed, finally found an explanation which appeared plausible to his companions.</p>
<p>"Throat of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>! are the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canon_(fiction)" property="schema:name">canons</span> defending themselves? To the sack, then! to the sack!"</p>
<p>"To the sack!" repeated the rabble, with a furious hurrah. A discharge of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crossbow" property="schema:name">crossbows</span> and hackbuts against the front of the church followed.</p>
<p>At this detonation, the peaceable inhabitants of the surrounding houses woke up; many windows were seen to open, and nightcaps and hands holding candles appeared at the casements.</p>
<p>"Fire at the windows," shouted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>. The windows were immediately closed, and the poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span>, who had hardly had time to cast a frightened glance on this scene of gleams and tumult, returned, perspiring with fear to their wives, asking themselves whether the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witches'_Sabbath" property="schema:name">witches' sabbath</span> was now being held in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parvise" property="schema:name">parvis</span> of Notre-Dame, or whether there was an assault of Burgundians, as in '64. Then the husbands thought of theft; the wives, of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rape" property="schema:name">rape</span>; and all trembled.</p>
<p>"To the sack!" repeated the thieves' crew; but they dared not approach. They stared at the beam, they stared at the church. The beam did not stir, the edifice preserved its calm and deserted air; but something chilled the outcasts.</p>
<p>"To work, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lock_(device)" property="schema:name">locksmiths</span>!" shouted Trouillefou. "Let the door be forced!"</p>
<p>No one took a step.</p>
<p>"Beard and belly!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>, "here be men afraid of a beam."</p>
<p>An old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lock_(device)" property="schema:name">locksmith</span> addressed him—</p>
<p>"Captain, 'tis not the beam which bothers us, 'tis the door, which is all covered with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> bars. Our <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claw" property="schema:name">pincers</span> are powerless against it."</p>
<p>"What more do you want to break it in?" demanded <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>.</p>
<p>"Ah! we ought to have a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battering_ram" property="schema:name">battering ram</span>."</p>
<p>The King of Thunes ran boldly to the formidable beam, and placed his foot upon it: "Here is one!" he exclaimed; "'tis the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canon_(music)" property="schema:name">canons</span> who send it to you." And, making a mocking salute in the direction of the church, "Thanks, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canon_(music)" property="schema:name">canons</span>!"</p>
<p>This piece of bravado produced its effects,—the spell of the beam was broken. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span> recovered their courage; soon the heavy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joist" property="schema:name">joist</span>, raised like a feather by two hundred vigorous arms, was flung with fury against the great door which they had tried to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assault" property="schema:name">batter</span> down. At the sight of that long beam, in the half-light which the infrequent torches of the brigands spread over the Place, thus borne by that crowd of men who dashed it at a run against the church, one would have thought that he beheld a monstrous beast with a thousand feet attacking with lowered head the giant of stone.</p>
<p>At the shock of the beam, the half metallic door sounded like an immense drum; it was not burst in, but the whole cathedral trembled, and the deepest cavities of the edifice were heard to echo.</p>
<p>At the same moment, a shower of large stones began to fall from the top of the façade on the assailants.</p>
<p>"The devil!" cried Jehan, "are the towers shaking their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrades</span> down on our heads?"</p>
<p>But the impulse had been given, the King of Thunes had set the example. Evidently, the bishop was defending himself, and they only battered the door with the more rage, in spite of the stones which cracked skulls right and left.</p>
<p>It was remarkable that all these stones fell one by one; but they followed each other closely. The thieves always felt two at a time, one on their legs and one on their heads. There were few which did not deal their blow, and a large layer of dead and wounded lay bleeding and panting beneath the feet of the assailants who, now grown furious, replaced each other without intermission. The long beam continued to belabor the door, at regular intervals, like the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_(instrument)" property="schema:name">clapper</span> of a bell, the stones to rain down, the door to groan.</p>
<p>The reader has no doubt divined that this unexpected resistance which had exasperated the outcasts came from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>.</p>
<p>Chance had, unfortunately, favored the brave <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man.</p>
<p>When he had descended to the platform between the towers, his ideas were all in confusion. He had run up and down along the gallery for several minutes like a madman, surveying from above, the compact mass of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span> ready to hurl itself on the church, demanding the safety of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> from the devil or from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>. The thought had occurred to him of ascending to the southern <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">belfry</span> and sounding the alarm, but before he could have set the bell in motion, before Marie's voice could have uttered a single clamor, was there not time to burst in the door of the church ten times over? It was precisely the moment when the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lock_(device)" property="schema:name">locksmiths</span> were advancing upon it with their tools. What was to be done?</p>
<p>All at once, he remembered that some masons had been at work all day repairing the wall, the timber-work, and the roof of the south tower. This was a flash of light. The wall was of stone, the roof of lead, the timber-work of wood. (That prodigious timber-work, so dense that it was called "the forest.")</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> hastened to that tower. The lower chambers were, in fact, full of materials. There were piles of rough blocks of stone, sheets of lead in rolls, bundles of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lath" property="schema:name">laths</span>, heavy beams already notched with the saw, heaps of plaster.</p>
<p>Time was pressing, The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pike_(weapon)" property="schema:name">pikes</span> and hammers were at work below. With a strength which the sense of danger increased tenfold, he seized one of the beams—the longest and heaviest; he pushed it out through a loophole, then, grasping it again outside of the tower, he made it slide along the angle of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span> which surrounds the platform, and let it f<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Light-year" property="schema:name">ly</span> into the abyss. The enormous timber, during that fall of a hundred and sixty feet, scraping the wall, breaking the carvings, turned many times on its centre, like the arm of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Windmill" property="schema:name">windmill</span> flying off alone through space. At last it reached the ground, the horrible cry arose, and the black beam, as it rebounded from the pavement, resembled a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serpent_(symbolism)" property="schema:name">serpent</span> leaping.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> beheld the outcasts scatter at the fall of the beam, like ashes at the breath of a child. He took advantage of their fright, and while they were fixing a superstitious glance on the club which had fallen from heaven, and while they were putting out the eyes of the stone saints on the front with a discharge of arrows and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shotgun_shell" property="schema:name">buckshot</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was silently piling up plaster, stones, and rough blocks of stone, even the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Looting" property="schema:name">sacks</span> of tools belonging to the masons, on the edge of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span> from which the beam had already been hurled.</p>
<p>Thus, as soon as they began to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grade_(slope)" property="schema:name">batter</span> the grand door, the shower of rough blocks of stone began to fall, and it seemed to them that the church itself was being demolished over their heads.</p>
<p>Any one who could have beheld <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> at that moment would have been frightened. Independently of the projectiles which he had piled upon the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span>, he had collected a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory_management" property="schema:name">heap</span> of stones on the platform itself. As fast as the blocks on the exterior edge were exhausted, he drew on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory_management" property="schema:name">heap</span>. Then he stooped and rose, stooped and rose again with incredible activity. His huge <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gnome" property="schema:name">gnome</span>'s head bent over the balustrade, then an enormous stone fell, then another, then another. From time to time, he followed a fine stone with his eye, and when it did good execution, he said, "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hum_(band)" property="schema:name">Hum</span>!"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the beggars did not grow discouraged. The thick door on which they were venting their fury had already trembled more than twenty times beneath the weight of their oaken battering-ram, multiplied by the strength of a hundred men. The panels cracked, the carved work flew into splinters, the hinges, at every blow, leaped from their pins, the planks yawned, the wood crumbled to powder, ground between the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wrought_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> sheathing. Fortunately for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, there was more <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wrought_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> than wood.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he felt that the great door was yielding. Although he did not hear it, every blow of the ram reverberated simultaneously in the vaults of the church and within it. From above he beheld the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span>, filled with triumph and rage, shaking their fists at the gloomy façade; and both on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s account and his own he envied the wings of the owls which flitted away above his head in flocks.</p>
<p>His shower of stone blocks was not sufficient to repel the assailants.</p>
<p>At this moment of anguish, he noticed, a little lower down than the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span> whence he was crushing the thieves, two long stone gutters which discharged immediately over the great door; the internal orifice of these gutters terminated on the pavement of the platform. An idea occurred to him; he ran in search of a fagot in his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span>'s den, placed on this fagot a great many bundles of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lath" property="schema:name">laths</span>, and many rolls of lead, munitions which he had not employed so far, and having arranged this pile in front of the hole to the two gutters, he set it on fire with his lantern.</p>
<p>During this time, since the stones no longer fell, the outcasts ceased to gaze into the air. The bandits, panting like a pack of hounds who are forcing a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wild_boar" property="schema:name">boar</span> into his lair, pressed tumultuously round the great door, all disfigured by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battering_ram" property="schema:name">battering ram</span>, but still standing. They were waiting with a quiver for the great blow which should split it open. They vied with each other in pressing as close as possible, in order to dash among the first, when it should open, into that opulent cathedral, a vast <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reservoir" property="schema:name">reservoir</span> where the wealth of three centuries had been piled up. They reminded each other with roars of exultation and greedy lust, of the beautiful silver crosses, the fine copes of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brocade" property="schema:name">brocade</span>, the beautiful tombs of silver gilt, the great <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catherine_de'_Medici's_court_festivals" property="schema:name">magnificences</span> of the choir, the dazzling festivals, the Christmasses sparkling with torches, the Easters sparkling with sunshine,—all those splendid solemneties wherein <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chandelier" property="schema:name">chandeliers</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ciborium_(container)" property="schema:name">ciboriums</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_tabernacle" property="schema:name">tabernacles</span>, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reliquary" property="schema:name">reliquaries</span>, studded the altars with a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bread" property="schema:name">crust</span> of gold and diamonds. Certainly, at that fine moment, thieves and pseudo sufferers, doctors in stealing, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span>, were thinking much less of delivering the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> than of pillaging Notre-Dame. We could even easily believe that for a goodly number among them la <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">Esmeralda</span> was on<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Light-year" property="schema:name">ly</span> a pretext, if thieves needed pretexts.</p>
<p>All at once, at the moment when they were grouping themselves round the ram for a last effort, each one holding his breath and stiffening his muscles in order to communicate all his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span> to the decisive blow, a howl more frightful still than that which had burst forth and expired beneath the beam, rose among them. Those who did not cry out, those who were still alive, looked. Two streams of melted lead were falling from the summit of the edifice into the thickest of the rabble. That sea of men had just sunk down beneath the boiling metal, which had made, at the two points where it fell, two black and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Smoking" property="schema:name">smoking</span> holes in the crowd, such as hot water would make in snow. Dying men, half consumed and groaning with anguish, could be seen writhing there. Around these two principal streams there were drops of that horrible rain, which scattered over the assailants and entered their skulls like gimlets of fire. It was a heavy fire which overwhelmed these wretches with a thousand <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hail" property="schema:name">hailstones</span>.</p>
<p>The outcry was heartrending. They fled pell-mell, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hurling" property="schema:name">hurling</span> the beam upon the bodies, the boldest as well as the most timid, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parvise" property="schema:name">parvis</span> was cleared a second time.</p>
<p>All eyes were raised to the top of the church. They beheld there an extraordinary sight. On the crest of the highest gallery, higher than the central <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rose_window" property="schema:name">rose window</span>, there was a great <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire" property="schema:name">flame</span> rising between the two towers with whirlwinds of sparks, a vast, disordered, and furious <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire" property="schema:name">flame</span>, a tongue of which was borne into the smoke by the wind, from time to time. Below that fire, below the gloomy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span> with its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trefoil" property="schema:name">trefoils</span> showing darkly against its glare, two spouts with monster throats were <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vomiting" property="schema:name">vomiting</span> forth unceasingly that burning rain, whose silvery stream stood out against the shadows of the lower façade. As they approached the earth, these two jets of liquid lead spread out in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pulley" property="schema:name">sheaves</span>, like water springing from the thousand holes of a watering-pot. Above the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flame" property="schema:name">flame</span>, the enormous towers, two sides of each of which were visible in sharp outline, the one wholly black, the other wholly <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span>, seemed still more vast with all the immensity of the shadow which they cast even to the sky.</p>
<p>Their innumerable sculptures of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demon" property="schema:name">demons</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dragon" property="schema:name">dragons</span> assumed a lugubrious aspect. The restless light of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flame" property="schema:name">flame</span> made them move to the eye. There were <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Griffin" property="schema:name">griffins</span> which had the air of laughing, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gargoyle" property="schema:name">gargoyles</span> which one fancied one heard yelping, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salamander" property="schema:name">salamanders</span> which puffed at the fire, tarasques* which sneezed in the smoke. And among the monsters thus roused from their sleep of stone by this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flame" property="schema:name">flame</span>, by this noise, there was one who walked about, and who was seen, from time to time, to pass across the glowing face of the pile, like a bat in front of a candle.</p></body></html>
