<h2 id="pgepubid00017">CHAPTER IV. THE INCONVENIENCES OF FOLLOWING A <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pretty_Woman" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">PRETTY WOMAN</span> THROUGH THE</h2>
<p>STREETS IN THE EVENING.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> set out to follow the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> at all hazards. He had seen her, accompanied by her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, take to the Rue de la Coutellerie; he took the Rue de la Coutellerie.</p>
<p>"Why not?" he said to himself.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, a practical <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span> of the streets of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, had noticed that nothing is more propitious to revery than following a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pretty_Woman" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">pretty woman</span> without knowing whither she is going. There was in this voluntary abdication of his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/free_will" property="schema:name">freewill</span>, in this fancy submitting itself to another fancy, which suspects it not, a mixture of fantastic independence and blind obedience, something indescribable, intermediate between <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slavery" property="schema:name">slavery</span> and liberty, which pleased <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>,—a spirit essentially compound, undecided, and complex, holding the extremities of all extremes, incessantly suspended between all human propensities, and neutralizing one by the other. He was fond of comparing himself to Mahomet's coffin, attracted in two different directions by two loadstones, and hesitating eternally between the heights and the depths, between the vault and the pavement, between fall and ascent, between zenith and nadir.</p>
<p>If <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> had lived in our day, what a fine middle course he would hold between <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classicism" property="schema:name">classicism</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanticism" property="schema:name">romanticism</span>!</p>
<p>But he was not sufficiently primitive to live three hundred years, and 'tis a pity. His absence is a void which is but too sensibly felt to-day.</p>
<p>Moreover, for the purpose of thus following passers-by (and especially female passers-by) in the streets, which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> was fond of doing, there is no better disposition than ignorance of where one is going to sleep.</p>
<p>So he walked along, very thoughtfully, behind the young girl, who hastened her pace and made her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trot" property="schema:name">trot</span> as she saw the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> returning home and the taverns—the only shops which had been open that day—closing.</p>
<p>"After all," he half thought to himself, "she must lodge somewhere; gypsies have kindly hearts. Who knows?—"</p>
<p>And in the points of suspense which he placed after this reticence in his mind, there lay I know not what flattering ideas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, from time to time, as he passed the last groups of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> closing their doors, he caught some scraps of their conversation, which broke the thread of his pleasant hypotheses.</p>
<p>Now it was two old men accosting each other.</p>
<p>"Do you know that it is cold, Master Thibaut Fernicle?" (<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> had been aware of this since the beginning of the winter.)</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed, Master Boniface Disome! Are we going to have a winter such as we had three years ago, in '80, when wood cost eight sous the measure?"</p>
<p>"Bah! that's nothing, Master Thibaut, compared with the winter of 1407, when it froze from St. Martin's Day until <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Presentation_of_Jesus_at_the_Temple" property="schema:name">Candlemas</span>! and so cold that the pen of the registrar of the parliament froze every three words, in the Grand Chamber! which interrupted the registration of justice."</p>
<p>Further on there were two female neighbors at their windows, holding candles, which the fog caused to sputter.</p>
<p>"Has your husband told you about the mishap, Mademoiselle la Boudraque?"</p>
<p>"No. What is it, Mademoiselle Turquant?"</p>
<p>"The horse of M. Gilles Godin, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Notary" property="schema:name">notary</span> at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Châtelet</span>, took fright at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemings</span> and their procession, and overturned Master Philippe Avrillot, lay monk of the Célestins."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Actually."</p>
<p>"A <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> horse! 'tis rather too much! If it had been a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry" property="schema:name">cavalry</span> horse, well and good!"</p>
<p>And the windows were closed. But <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> had lost the thread of his ideas, nevertheless.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he speedily found it again, and he knotted it together without difficulty, thanks to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, thanks to Djali, who still walked in front of him; two fine, delicate, and charming creatures, whose tiny feet, beautiful forms, and graceful manners he was engaged in admiring, almost confusing them in his contemplation; believing them to be both young girls, from their intelligence and good friendship; regarding them both as <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goats</span>,—so far as the lightness, agility, and dexterity of their walk were concerned.</p>
<p>But the streets were becoming blacker and more deserted every moment. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Curfew" property="schema:name">curfew</span> had sounded long ago, and it was only at rare intervals now that they encountered a passer-by in the street, or a light in the windows. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> had become involved, in his pursuit of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, in that inextricable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labyrinth" property="schema:name">labyrinth</span> of alleys, squares, and closed courts which surround the ancient sepulchre of the Saints-Innocents, and which resembles a ball of thread tangled by a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" property="schema:name">cat</span>. "Here are streets which possess but little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Logic" property="schema:name">logic</span>!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, lost in the thousands of circuits which returned upon themselves incessantly, but where the young girl pursued a road which seemed familiar to her, without hesitation and with a step which became ever more rapid. As for him, he would have been utterly ignorant of his situation had he not espied, in passing, at the turn of a street, the octagonal mass of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fish" property="schema:name">fish</span> markets, the open-work summit of which threw its black, fretted outlines clearly upon a window which was still lighted in the Rue Verdelet.</p>
<p>The young girl's attention had been attracted to him for the last few moments; she had repeatedly turned her head towards him with uneasiness; she had even once come to a standstill, and taking advantage of a ray of light which escaped from a half-open bakery to survey him intently, from head to foot, then, having cast this glance, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> had seen her make that little pout which he had already noticed, after which she passed on.</p>
<p>This little pout had furnished <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> with food for thought. There was certainly both disdain and mockery in that graceful grimace. So he dropped his head, began to count the paving-stones, and to follow the young girl at a little greater distance, when, at the turn of a street, which had caused him to lose sight of her, he heard her utter a piercing cry.</p>
<p>He hastened his steps.</p>
<p>The street was full of shadows. Nevertheless, a twist of tow soaked in oil, which burned in a cage at the feet of the Holy Virgin at the street corner, permitted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> to make out the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> struggling in the arms of two men, who were endeavoring to stifle her cries. The poor little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, in great alarm, lowered his horns and bleated.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Help!_(film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">Help!</span> gentlemen of the watch!" shouted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, and advanced bravely. One of the men who held the young girl turned towards him. It was the formidable visage of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> did not take to flight, but neither did he advance another step.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> came up to him, tossed him four paces away on the pavement with a backward turn of the hand, and plunged rapidly into the gloom, bearing the young girl folded across one arm like a silken scarf. His companion followed him, and the poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> ran after them all, bleating plaintively.</p>
<p>"Murder! murder!" shrieked the unhappy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>.</p>
<p>"Halt, rascals, and yield me that wench!" suddenly shouted in a voice of thunder, a cavalier who appeared suddenly from a neighboring square.</p>
<p>It was a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(cricket)" property="schema:name">captain</span> of the king's archers, armed from head to foot, with his sword in his hand.</p>
<p>He tore the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> from the arms of the dazed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, threw her across his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saddle" property="schema:name">saddle</span>, and at the moment when the terrible hunchback, recovering from his surprise, rushed upon him to regain his prey, fifteen or sixteen archers, who followed their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(cricket)" property="schema:name">captain</span> closely, made their appearance, with their two-edged swords in their fists. It was a squad of the king's police, which was making the rounds, by order of Messire Robert d'Estouteville, guard of the provostship of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was surrounded, seized, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garrote" property="schema:name">garroted</span>; he roared, he foamed at the mouth, he bit; and had it been broad daylight, there is no doubt that his face alone, rendered more hideous by wrath, would have put the entire squad to flight. But by night he was deprived of his most formidable weapon, his ugliness.</p>
<p>His companion had disappeared during the struggle.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> gracefully raised herself upright upon the officer's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saddle" property="schema:name">saddle</span>, placed both hands upon the young man's shoulders, and gazed fixedly at him for several seconds, as though enchanted with his good looks and with the aid which he had just rendered her. Then breaking silence first, she said to him, making her sweet voice still sweeter than usual,—</p>
<p>"What is your name, monsieur le <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gendarmerie" property="schema:name">gendarme</span>?"</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_Phoebus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Captain Phoebus</span> de Châteaupers, at your service, my beauty!" replied the officer, drawing himself up.</p>
<p>"Thanks," said she.</p>
<p>And while <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_Phoebus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Captain Phoebus</span> was turning up his moustache in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duke_of_Burgundy" property="schema:name">Burgundian</span> fashion, she slipped from the horse, like an arrow falling to earth, and fled.</p>
<p>A flash of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lightning" property="schema:name">lightning</span> would have vanished less quickly.</p>
<p>"Nombrill of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span>!" said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>, causing <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>'s straps to be drawn tighter, "I should have preferred to keep the wench."</p>
<p>"What would you have, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>?" said one <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gendarmerie" property="schema:name">gendarme</span>. "The warbler has fled, and the bat remains."</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00018">CHAPTER <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/V." typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">V.</span> RESULT OF THE DANGERS.</h2>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, thoroughly stunned by his fall, remained on the pavement in front of the Holy Virgin at the street corner. Little by little, he regained his senses; at first, for several minutes, he was floating in a sort of half-somnolent revery, which was not without its charm, in which aeriel figures of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> and her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> were coupled with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>'s heavy fist. This state lasted but a short time. A decidedly vivid sensation of cold in the part of his body which was in contact with the pavement, suddenly aroused him and caused his spirit to return to the surface.</p>
<p>"Whence comes this chill?" he said abruptly, to himself. He then perceived that he was lying half in the middle of the gutter.</p>
<p>"That devil of a hunchbacked <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyclops" property="schema:name">cyclops</span>!" he muttered between his teeth; and he tried to rise. But he was too much dazed and bruised; he was forced to remain where he was. Moreover, his hand was tolerably free; he stopped up his nose and resigned himself.</p>
<p>"The mud of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>," he said to himself—for decidedly he thought that he was sure that the gutter would prove his refuge for the night; and what can one do in a refuge, except dream?—"the mud of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> is particularly stinking; it must contain a great deal of volatile and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nitric_acid" property="schema:name">nitric</span> salts. That, moreover, is the opinion of Master <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolas_Flamel" property="schema:name">Nicholas Flamel</span>, and of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alchemy" property="schema:name">alchemists</span>—"</p>
<p>The word "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alchemy" property="schema:name">alchemists</span>" suddenly suggested to his mind the idea of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">Archdeacon</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>. He recalled the violent scene which he had just witnessed in part; that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> was struggling with two men, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had a companion; and the morose and haughty face of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> passed confusedly through his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span>. "That would be strange!" he said to himself. And on that fact and that basis he began to construct a fantastic edifice of hypothesis, that card-castle of philosophers; then, suddenly returning once more to reality, "Come! I'm freezing!" he ejaculated.</p>
<p>The place was, in fact, becoming less and less tenable. Each molecule of the gutter bore away a molecule of heat radiating from Gringoire's loins, and the equilibrium between the temperature of his body and the temperature of the brook, began to be established in rough fashion.</p>
<p>Quite a different annoyance suddenly assailed him. A group of children, those little bare-footed savages who have always roamed the pavements of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> under the eternal name of <i>gamins</i>, and who, when we were also children ourselves, threw stones at all of us in the afternoon, when we came out of school, because our trousers were not torn—a swarm of these young scamps rushed towards the square where Gringoire lay, with shouts and laughter which seemed to pay but little heed to the sleep of the neighbors. They were dragging after them some sort of hideous sack; and the noise of their wooden shoes alone would have roused the dead. Gringoire who was not quite dead yet, half raised himself.</p>
<p>"Ohé, Hennequin Dandéche! Ohè, Jehan Pincebourde!" they shouted in deafening tones, "old Eustache Moubon, the merchant at the corner, has just died. We've got his straw pallet, we're <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_India" property="schema:name">goi</span>ng to have a bonfire out of it. It's the turn of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemish</span> to-day!"</p>
<p>And behold, they flung the pallet directly upon <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, beside whom they had arrived, without espying him. At the same time, one of them took a handful of straw and set off to light it at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capillary_action" property="schema:name">wick</span> of the good Virgin.</p>
<p>"S'death!" growled <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "am I going to be too warm now?"</p>
<p>It was a critical moment. He was caught between fire and water; he made a superhuman effort, the effort of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Counterfeit" property="schema:name">counterfeiter</span> of money who is on the point of being boiled, and who seeks to escape. He rose to his feet, flung aside the straw pallet upon the street urchins, and fled.</p>
<p>"Holy Virgin!" shrieked the children; "'tis the merchant's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghost" property="schema:name">ghost</span>!"</p>
<p>And they fled in their turn.</p>
<p>The straw <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mattress" property="schema:name">mattress</span> remained master of the field. Belleforet, Father Le Juge, and Corrozet affirm that it was picked up on the morrow, with great pomp, by the clergy of the quarter, and borne to the treasury of the church of Saint Opportune, where the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sacristan" property="schema:name">sacristan</span>, even as late as 1789, earned a tolerably handsome revenue out of the great miracle of the Statue of the Virgin at the corner of the Rue Mauconseil, which had, by its mere presence, on the memorable night between the sixth and seventh of January, 1482, exorcised the defunct Eustache Moubon, who, in order to play a trick on the devil, had at his death maliciously concealed his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> in his straw pallet.</p>
<p><a id="link2HCH0012"><!--  H2 anchor --></a></p>
<div class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/></div>
<h2 id="pgepubid00019">CHAPTER VI. THE BROKEN JUG.</h2>
<p>After having run for some time at the top of his speed, without knowing whither, knocking his head against many a street corner, leaping many a gutter, traversing many an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alley" property="schema:name">alley</span>, many a court, many a square, seeking flight and passage through all the meanderings of the ancient passages of the Halles, exploring in his panic terror what the fine <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span> of the maps calls <i>tota via, cheminum et viaria</i>, our poet suddenly halted for lack of breath in the first place, and in the second, because he had been collared, after a fashion, by a dilemma which had just occurred to his mind. "It strikes me, Master <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span>," he said to himself, placing his finger to his brow, "that you are running like a madman. The little scamps are no less afraid of you than you are of them. It strikes me, I say, that you heard the clatter of their wooden shoes fleeing southward, while you were fleeing northward. Now, one of two things, either they have taken flight, and the pallet, which they must have forgotten in their terror, is precisely that hospitable bed in search of which you have been running ever since morning, and which madame the Virgin miraculously sends you, in order to recompense you for having made a morality in her honor, accompanied by triumphs and mummeries; or the children have not taken flight, and in that case they have put the brand to the pallet, and that is precisely the good fire which you need to cheer, dry, and warm you. In either case, good fire or good bed, that straw pallet is a gift from heaven. The blessed Virgin Marie who stands at the corner of the Rue Mauconseil, could only have made Eustache Moubon die for that express purpose; and it is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folly" property="schema:name">folly</span> on your part to flee thus zigzag, like a Picard before a Frenchman, leaving behind you what you seek before you; and you are a fool!"</p>
<p>Then he retraced his steps, and feeling his way and searching, with his nose to the wind and his ears on the alert, he tried to find the blessed pallet again, but in vain. There was nothing to be found but intersections of houses, closed courts, and crossings of streets, in the midst of which he hesitated and doubted incessantly, being more perplexed and entangled in this medley of streets than he would have been even in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labyrinth" property="schema:name">labyrinth</span> of the Hôtel des Tournelles. At length he lost patience, and exclaimed solemnly: "Cursed be cross roads! 'tis the devil who has made them in the shape of his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pitchfork" property="schema:name">pitchfork</span>!"</p>
<p>This exclamation afforded him a little solace, and a sort of reddish reflection which he caught sight of at that moment, at the extremity of a long and narrow lane, completed the elevation of his moral tone. "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> be praised!" said he, "There it is yonder! There is my pallet burning." And comparing himself to the pilot who suffers shipwreck by night, "<i>Salve</i>," he added piously, "<i>salve, maris stella</i>!"</p>
<p>Did he address this fragment of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Litany" property="schema:name">litany</span> to the Holy Virgin, or to the pallet? We are utterly unable to say.</p>
<p>He had taken but a few steps in the long street, which sloped downwards, was unpaved, and more and more muddy and steep, when he noticed a very singular thing. It was not deserted; here and there along its extent crawled certain vague and formless masses, all directing their course towards the light which flickered at the end of the street, like those heavy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Insect" property="schema:name">insects</span> which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drag_(physics)" property="schema:name">drag</span> along by night, from blade to blade of grass, towards the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shepherd" property="schema:name">shepherd</span>'s fire.</p>
<p>Nothing renders one so adventurous as not being able to feel the place where one's pocket is situated. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> continued to advance, and had soon joined that one of the forms which dragged along most indolently, behind the others. On drawing near, he perceived that it was nothing else than a wretched legless cripple in a bowl, who was hopping along on his two hands like a wounded field-spider which has but two legs left. At the moment when he passed close to this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Species" property="schema:name">species</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider" property="schema:name">spider</span> with a human countenance, it raised towards him a lamentable voice: "<i>La buona mancia, signor! la buona mancia</i>!"*</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  Alms.<br/></div>
<p>"Deuce take you," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "and me with you, if I know what you mean!"</p>
<p>And he passed on.</p>
<p>He overtook another of these itinerant masses, and examined it. It was an impotent man, both halt and crippled, and halt and crippled to such a degree that the complicated system of crutches and wooden legs which sustained him, gave him the air of a mason's scaffolding on the march. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, who liked noble and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_mechanics" property="schema:name">classical</span> comparisons, compared him in thought to the living <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tripod" property="schema:name">tripod</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vulcan_(Star_Trek)" property="schema:name">Vulcan</span>.</p>
<p>This living <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tripod" property="schema:name">tripod</span> saluted him as he passed, but stopping his hat on a level with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>'s chin, like a shaving dish, while he shouted in the latter's ears: "<i>Senor cabellero, para comprar un pedaso de pan</i>!"*</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  Give me the means to buy a bit of bread, sir.<br/></div>
<p>"It appears," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "that this one can also talk; but 'tis a rude language, and he is more fortunate than I if he understands it." Then, smiting his brow, in a sudden transition of ideas: "By the way, what the deuce did they mean this morning with their Esmeralda?"</p>
<p>He was minded to augment his pace, but for the third time something barred his way. This something or, rather, some one was a blind man, a little blind fellow with a bearded, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jews" property="schema:name">Jewish</span> face, who, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Watercraft_rowing" property="schema:name">rowing</span> away in the space about him with a stick, and towed by a large <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">dog</span>, droned through his nose with a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hungarian_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Hungarian</span> accent: "<i>Facitote caritatem</i>!"</p>
<p>"Well, now," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "here's one at last who speaks a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian" property="schema:name">Christian</span> tongue. I must have a very charitable aspect, since they ask <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alms" property="schema:name">alms</span> of me in the present lean condition of my purse. My friend," and he turned towards the blind man, "I sold my last shirt last week; that is to say, since you understand only the language of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Cicero</span>: <i>Vendidi hebdomade nuper transita meam ultimam chemisan</i>."</p>
<p>That said, he turned his back upon the blind man, and pursued his way. But the blind man began to increase his stride at the same time; and, behold! the cripple and the legless man, in his bowl, came up on their side in great haste, and with great clamor of bowl and crutches, upon the pavement. Then all three, jostling each other at poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>'s heels, began to sing their song to him,—</p>
<p>"<i>Caritatem</i>!" chanted the blind man.</p>
<p>"<i>La buona mancia</i>!" chanted the cripple in the bowl.</p>
<p>And the lame man took up the musical phrase by repeating: "<i>Un pedaso de pan</i>!"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> stopped up his ears. "Oh, tower of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon" property="schema:name">Babel</span>!" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>He set out to run. The blind man ran! The lame man ran! The cripple in the bowl ran!</p>
<p>And then, in proportion as he plunged deeper into the street, cripples in bowls, blind men and lame men, swarmed about him, and men with one arm, and with one eye, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leprosy" property="schema:name">leprous</span> with their sores, some emerging from little streets adjacent, some from the air-holes of cellars, howling, bellowing, yelping, all limping and halting, all flinging themselves towards the light, and humped up in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bog" property="schema:name">mire</span>, like snails after a shower.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, still followed by his three persecutors, and not knowing very well what was to become of him, marched along in terror among them, turning out for the lame, stepping over the cripples in bowls, with his feet imbedded in that ant-hill of lame men, like the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">English</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> who got caught in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quicksand" property="schema:name">quicksand</span> of a swarm of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crab" property="schema:name">crabs</span>.</p>
<p>The idea occurred to him of making an effort to retrace his steps. But it was too late. This whole legion had closed in behind him, and his three beggars held him fast. So he proceeded, impelled both by this irresistible flood, by fear, and by a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vertigo" property="schema:name">vertigo</span> which converted all this into a sort of horrible <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dr._Dre" property="schema:name">dre</span>am.</p>
<p>At last he reached the end of the street. It opened upon an immense place, where a thousand scattered lights flickered in the confused mists of night. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> flew thither, hoping to escape, by the swiftness of his legs, from the three infirm spectres who had clutched him.</p>
<p>"<i>Onde vas, hombre</i>?" (Where are you going, my man?) cried the cripple, flinging away his crutches, and running after him with the best legs that ever traced a geometrical step upon the pavements of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>.</p>
<p>In the meantime the legless man, erect upon his feet, crowned <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> with his heavy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron_Bowl" property="schema:name">iron bowl</span>, and the blind man glared in his face with flaming eyes!</p>
<p>"Where am I?" said the terrified poet.</p>
<p>"In the Court of Miracles," replied a fourth spectre, who had accosted them.</p>
<p>"Upon my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>," resumed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "I certainly do behold the blind who see, and the lame who walk, but where is the Saviour?"</p>
<p>They replied by a burst of sinister laughter.</p>
<p>The poor poet cast his eyes about him. It was, in truth, that redoubtable Cour des Miracles, whither an honest man had never penetrated at such an hour; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span> circle where the officers of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Châtelet</span> and the sergeants of the provostship, who ventured thither, disappeared in morsels; a city of thieves, a hideous wart on the face of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>; a sewer, from which escaped every morning, and whither returned every night to crouch, that stream of vices, of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mendicant" property="schema:name">mendicancy</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabondage</span> which always overflows in the streets of capitals; a monstrous hive, to which returned at nightfall, with their booty, all the drones of the social order; a lying hospital where the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemianism" property="schema:name">bohemian</span>, the disfrocked monk, the ruined scholar, the ne'er-do-wells of all nations, Spaniards, Italians, Germans,—of all religions, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jews" property="schema:name">Jews</span>, Christians, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mohammedan" property="schema:name">Mahometans</span>, idolaters, covered with painted sores, beggars by day, were transformed by night into brigands; an immense dressing-room, in a word, where, at that epoch, the actors of that eternal comedy, which theft, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" property="schema:name">prostitution</span>, and murder play upon the pavements of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, dressed and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Undressed" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">undressed</span>.</p>
<p>It was a vast place, irregular and badly paved, like all the squares of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> at that date. Fires, around which swarmed strange groups, blazed here and there. Every one was going, coming, and shouting. Shrill laughter was to be heard, the wailing of children, the voices of women. The hands and heads of this throng, black against the luminous background, outlined against it a thousand eccentric gestures. At times, upon the ground, where trembled the light of the fires, mingled with large, indefinite shadows, one could behold a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">dog</span> passing, which resembled a man, a man who resembled a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">dog</span>. The limits of races and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Species" property="schema:name">species</span> seemed effaced in this city, as in a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pandemonium_(Killing_Joke_album)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">pandemonium</span>. Men, women, beasts, age, sex, health, maladies, all seemed to be in common among these people; all went together, they mingled, confounded, superposed; each one there participated in all.</p>
<p>The poor and flickering flames of the fire permitted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> to distinguish, amid his trouble, all around the immense place, a hideous frame of ancient houses, whose wormeaten, shrivelled, stunted façades, each pierced with one or two lighted attic windows, seemed to him, in the darkness, like enormous heads of old women, ranged in a circle, monstrous and crabbed, winking as they looked on at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witches'_Sabbath" property="schema:name">Witches' Sabbath</span>.</p>
<p>It was like a new world, unknown, unheard of, misshapen, creeping, swarming, fantastic.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, more and more terrified, clutched by the three beggars as by three pairs of tongs, dazed by a throng of other faces which frothed and yelped around him, unhappy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> endeavored to summon his presence of mind, in order to recall whether it was a Saturday. But his efforts were vain; the thread of his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span> and of his thought was broken; and, doubting everything, wavering between what he saw and what he felt, he put to himself this unanswerable question,—</p>
<p>"If I exist, does this exist? if this exists, do I exist?"</p>
<p>At that moment, a distinct cry arose in the buzzing throng which surrounded him, "Let's take him to the king! let's take him to the king!"</p>
<p>"Holy Virgin!" <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathy_voice" property="schema:name">murmured</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "the king here must be a ram."</p>
<p>"To the king! to the king!" repeated all voices.</p>
<p>They dragged him off. Each vied with the other in laying his claws upon him. But the three beggars did not loose their hold and tore him from the rest, howling, "He belongs to us!"</p>
<p>The poet's already sickly <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doublet_(clothing)" property="schema:name">doublet</span> yielded its last sigh in this struggle.</p>
<p>While traversing the horrible place, his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vertigo" property="schema:name">vertigo</span> vanished. After taking a few steps, the sentiment of reality returned to him. He began to become accustomed to the atmosphere of the place. At the first moment there had arisen from his poet's head, or, simply and prosaically, from his empty stomach, a mist, a vapor, so to speak, which, spreading between objects and himself, permitted him to catch a glimpse of them only in the incoherent fog of nightmare,—in those shadows of dreams which distort every outline, agglomerating objects into unwieldy groups, dilating things into <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chimera_(mythology)" property="schema:name">chimeras</span>, and men into phantoms. Little by little, this hallucination was succeeded by a less bewildered and exaggerating view. Reality made its way to the light around him, struck his eyes, struck his feet, and demolished, bit by bit, all that frightful poetry with which he had, at first, believed himself to be surrounded. He was forced to perceive that he was not walking in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Styx" property="schema:name">Styx</span>, but in mud, that he was elbowed not by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demon" property="schema:name">demons</span>, but by thieves; that it was not his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> which was in question, but his life (since he lacked that precious conciliator, which places itself so effectually between the bandit and the honest man—a purse). In short, on examining the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orgy" property="schema:name">orgy</span> more closely, and with more coolness, he fell from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witches'_Sabbath" property="schema:name">witches' sabbath</span> to the dram-shop.</p>
<p>The Cour des Miracles was, in fact, merely a dram-shop; but a brigand's dram-shop, reddened quite as much with blood as with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span>.</p>
<p>The spectacle which presented itself to his eyes, when his ragged escort finally deposited him at the end of his trip, was not fitted to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bear" property="schema:name">bear</span> him back to poetry, even to the poetry of hell. It was more than ever the prosaic and brutal reality of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pub" property="schema:name">tavern</span>. Were we not in the fifteenth century, we would say that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> had descended from Michael Angelo to Callot.</p>
<p>Around a great fire which burned on a large, circular <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dimension_stone" property="schema:name">flagstone</span>, the flames of which had heated red-hot the legs of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tripod" property="schema:name">tripod</span>, which was empty for the moment, some wormeaten tables were placed, here and there, haphazard, no lackey of a geometrical turn having deigned to adjust their parallelism, or to see to it that they did not make too unusual angles. Upon these tables gleamed several dripping pots of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beer" property="schema:name">beer</span>, and round these pots were grouped many <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dionysus" property="schema:name">bacchic</span> visages, purple with the fire and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span>. There was a man with a huge belly and a jovial face, noisily kissing a woman of the town, thickset and brawny. There was a sort of sham soldier, a "naquois," as the slang expression runs, who was whistling as he undid the bandages from his fictitious wound, and removing the numbness from his sound and vigorous knee, which had been swathed since morning in a thousand <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strangling" property="schema:name">ligatures</span>. On the other hand, there was a wretched fellow, preparing with celandine and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beef" property="schema:name">beef</span>'s blood, his "leg of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>," for the next day. Two tables further on, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palmer_(pilgrim)" property="schema:name">palmer</span>, with his pilgrim's costume complete, was practising the lament of the Holy Queen, not forgetting the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drone_(music)" property="schema:name">drone</span> and the nasal drawl. Further on, a young scamp was taking a lesson in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epilepsy" property="schema:name">epilepsy</span> from an old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pretender" property="schema:name">pretender</span>, who was instructing him in the art of foaming at the mouth, by chewing a morsel of soap. Beside him, a man with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edema" property="schema:name">dropsy</span> was getting rid of his swelling, and making four or five female thieves, who were disputing at the same table, over a child who had been stolen that evening, hold their noses. All circumstances which, two centuries later, "seemed so ridiculous to the court," as Sauval says, "that they served as a pastime to the king, and as an introduction to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Royal_Ballet" property="schema:name">royal ballet</span> of Night, divided into four parts and danced on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theatre" property="schema:name">theatre</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hôtel_du_Petit-Bourbon" property="schema:name">Petit-Bourbon</span>." "Never," adds an eye witness of 1653, "have the sudden metamorphoses of the Court of Miracles been more happily presented. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_de_Benserade" property="schema:name">Benserade</span> prepared us for it by some very gallant verses."</p>
<p>Loud laughter everywhere, and obscene songs. Each one held his own course, carping and swearing, without listening to his neighbor. Pots clinked, and quarrels sprang up at the shock of the pots, and the broken pots made rents in the rags.</p>
<p>A big <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">dog</span>, seated on his tail, gazed at the fire. Some children were mingled in this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orgy" property="schema:name">orgy</span>. The stolen child wept and cried. Another, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Big_Boy_(radio_host)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">big boy</span> four years of age, seated with legs dangling, upon a bench that was too high for him, before a table that reached to his chin, and uttering not a word. A third, gravely spreading out upon the table with his finger, the melted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tallow" property="schema:name">tallow</span> which dripped from a candle. Last of all, a little fellow crouching in the mud, almost lost in a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cauldron" property="schema:name">cauldron</span>, which he was scraping with a tile, and from which he was evoking a sound that would have made <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stradivarius" property="schema:name">Stradivarius</span> swoon.</p>
<p>Near the fire was a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hogshead" property="schema:name">hogshead</span>, and on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hogshead" property="schema:name">hogshead</span> a beggar. This was the king on his throne.</p>
<p>The three who had <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> in their clutches led him in front of this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hogshead" property="schema:name">hogshead</span>, and the entire <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bacchanalia" property="schema:name">bacchanal</span> rout fell <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span> for a moment, with the exception of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cauldron" property="schema:name">cauldron</span> inhabited by the child.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> dared neither breathe nor raise his eyes.</p>
<p>"<i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Man" property="schema:name">Hombre</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keta" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">quita</span> tu <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sombrero" property="schema:name">sombrero</span></i>!" said one of the three knaves, in whose grasp he was, and, before he had comprehended the meaning, the other had snatched his hat—a wretched headgear, it is true, but still good on a sunny day or when there was but little rain. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> sighed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the king addressed him, from the summit of his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barrel" property="schema:name">cask</span>,—</p>
<p>"Who is this rogue?"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> shuddered. That voice, although accentuated by menace, recalled to him another voice, which, that very morning, had dealt the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deathblow" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">deathblow</span> to his mystery, by drawling, nasally, in the midst of the audience, "Charity, please!" He raised his head. It was indeed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span>.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span>, arrayed in his royal insignia, wore neither one rag more nor one rag less. The sore upon his arm had already disappeared. He held in his hand one of those whips made of thongs of white leather, which police sergeants then used to repress the crowd, and which were called <i>boullayes</i>. On his head he wore a sort of headgear, bound round and closed at the top. But it was difficult to make out whether it was a child's cap or a king's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span>, the two things bore so strong a resemblance to each other.</p>
<p>Meanwhile <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, without knowing why, had regained some hope, on recognizing in the King of the Cour des Miracles his accursed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mendicant" property="schema:name">mendicant</span> of the Grand Hall.</p>
<p>"Master," stammered he; "monseigneur—sire—how ought I to address you?" he said at length, having reached the culminating point of his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dynamics_(music)" property="schema:name">crescendo</span>, and knowing neither how to mount higher, nor to descend again.</p>
<p>"Monseigneur, his majesty, or comrade, call me what you please. But make haste. What have you to say in your own defence?"</p>
<p>"In your own defence?" thought <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "that displeases me." He resumed, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stuttering" property="schema:name">stuttering</span>, "I am he, who this morning—"</p>
<p>"By the devil's claws!" interrupted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>, "your name, knave, and nothing more. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Listen_(Beyoncé_Knowles_song)" property="schema:name">Listen</span>. You are in the presence of three powerful sovereigns: myself, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span> Trouillefou, King of Thunes, successor to the Grand Coësre, supreme <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suzerainty" property="schema:name">suzerain</span> of the Realm of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argot" property="schema:name">Argot</span>; Mathias Hunyadi Spicali, Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egypt</span> and of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bohemia</span>, the old yellow fellow whom you see yonder, with a dish clout round his head; Guillaume <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Rousseau</span>, Emperor of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galilee" property="schema:name">Galilee</span>, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fat" property="schema:name">fat</span> fellow who is not listening to us but caressing a wench. We are your judges. You have entered the Kingdom of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argot" property="schema:name">Argot</span>, without being an <i>argotier</i>; you have violated the privileges of our city. You must be punished unless you are a <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capon" property="schema:name">capon</span></i>, a <i>franc-mitou</i> or a <i>rifodé</i>; that is to say, in the slang of honest folks,—a thief, a beggar, or a vagabond. Are you anything of that sort? Justify yourself; announce your titles."</p>
<p>"Alas!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "I have not that honor. I am the author—"</p>
<p>"That is sufficient," resumed Trouillefou, without permitting him to finish. "You are going to be hanged. 'Tis a very simple matter, gentlemen and honest <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span>! as you treat our people in your abode, so we treat you in ours! The law which you apply to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span> apply to you. 'Tis your fault if it is harsh. One really must behold the grimace of an honest man above the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hemp" property="schema:name">hempen</span> collar now and then; that renders the thing honorable. Come, friend, divide your rags gayly among these damsels. I am going to have you hanged to amuse the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span>, and you are to give them your purse to drink your health. If you have any <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mummers_Play" property="schema:name">mummery</span> to go through with, there's a very good <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> the Father in that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mortar_(weapon)" property="schema:name">mortar</span> yonder, in stone, which we stole from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Pierre_and_Miquelon" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Saint-Pierre</span> aux Boeufs. You have four minutes in which to fling your <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> at his head."</p>
<p>The harangue was formidable.</p>
<p>"Well said, upon my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span> preaches like the Holy Father the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span>!" exclaimed the Emperor of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galilee" property="schema:name">Galilee</span>, smashing his pot in order to prop up his table.</p>
<p>"Messeigneurs, emperors, and kings," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> coolly (for I know not how, firmness had returned to him, and he spoke with resolution), "don't think of such a thing; my name is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span>. I am the poet whose morality was presented this morning in the grand hall of the Courts."</p>
<p>"Ah! so it was you, master!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>. "I was there, <i>xête Dieu</i>! Well! comrade, is that any reason, because you bored us to death this morning, that you should not be hung this evening?"</p>
<p>"I shall find difficulty in getting out of it," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> to himself. Nevertheless, he made one more effort: "I don't see why poets are not classed with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span>," said he. "Vagabond, Aesopus certainly was; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Homerus</span> was a beggar; Mercurius was a thief—"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span> interrupted him: "I believe that you are trying to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blarney" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">blarney</span> us with your jargon. Zounds! let yourself be hung, and don't kick up such a row over it!"</p>
<p>"Pardon me, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monsignor" property="schema:name">monseigneur</span>, the King of Thunes," replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, disputing the ground foot by foot. "It is worth trouble—One moment!—<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Listen_(Beyoncé_Knowles_song)" property="schema:name">Listen</span> to me—You are not going to condemn me without having heard me"—</p>
<p>His unlucky voice was, in fact, drowned in the uproar which rose around him. The little boy scraped away at his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cauldron" property="schema:name">cauldron</span> with more spirit than ever; and, to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span> all, an old woman had just placed on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tripod" property="schema:name">tripod</span> a frying-pan of grease, which hissed away on the fire with a noise similar to the cry of a troop of children in pursuit of a masker.</p>
<p>In the meantime, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span> appeared to hold a momentary conference with the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egypt</span>, and the Emperor of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galilee" property="schema:name">Galilee</span>, who was completely drunk. Then he shouted shrilly: "Silence!" and, as the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cauldron" property="schema:name">cauldron</span> and the frying-pan did not heed him, and continued their duet, he jumped down from his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hogshead" property="schema:name">hogshead</span>, gave a kick to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boiler" property="schema:name">boiler</span>, which rolled ten paces away bearing the child with it, a kick to the frying-pan, which upset in the fire with all its grease, and gravely remounted his throne, without troubling himself about the stifled tears of the child, or the grumbling of the old woman, whose supper was wasting away in a fine white <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire" property="schema:name">flame</span>.</p>
<p>Trouillefou made a sign, and the duke, the emperor, and the passed masters of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pickpocketing" property="schema:name">pickpockets</span>, and the isolated robbers, came and ranged themselves around him in a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horseshoe" property="schema:name">horseshoe</span>, of which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, still roughly held by the body, formed the centre. It was a semicircle of rags, tatters, tinsel, pitchforks, axes, legs staggering with intoxication, huge, bare arms, faces sordid, dull, and stupid. In the midst of this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Round_Table" property="schema:name">Round Table</span> of beggary, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span>,—as the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">doge</span> of this senate, as the king of this peerage, as the pope of this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Papal_conclave" property="schema:name">conclave</span>,—dominated; first by virtue of the height of his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hogshead" property="schema:name">hogshead</span>, and next by virtue of an indescribable, haughty, fierce, and formidable air, which caused his eyes to flash, and corrected in his savage profile the bestial type of the race of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span>. One would have pronounced him a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wild_boar" property="schema:name">boar</span> amid a herd of swine.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Listen_(Beyoncé_Knowles_song)" property="schema:name">Listen</span>," said he to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, fondling his misshapen chin with his horny hand; "I don't see why you should not be hung. It is true that it appears to be repugnant to you; and it is very natural, for you <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> are not accustomed to it. You form for yourselves a great idea of the thing. After all, we don't wish you any harm. Here is a means of extricating yourself from your predicament for the moment. Will you become one of us?"</p>
<p>The reader can judge of the effect which this proposition produced upon <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, who beheld life slipping away from him, and who was beginning to lose his hold upon it. He clutched at it again with energy.</p>
<p>"Certainly I will, and right heartily," said he.</p>
<p>"Do you consent," resumed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>, "to enroll yourself among the people of the knife?"</p>
<p>"Of the knife, precisely," responded <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p>"You recognize yourself as a member of the free <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeoisie</span>?"* added the King of Thunes.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  A high-toned sharper.<br/></div>

<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  Thieves.<br/></div>
<p>"A vagabond?"</p>
<p>"A vagabond."</p>
<p>"In your <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>?"</p>
<p>"In my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>."</p>
<p>"I must call your attention to the fact," continued the king, "that you will be hung all the same."</p>
<p>"The devil!" said the poet.</p>
<p>"Only," continued <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span> imperturbably, "you will be hung later on, with more ceremony, at the expense of the good city of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, on a handsome stone <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span>, and by honest men. That is a consolation."</p>
<p>"Just so," responded <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p>"There are other advantages. In your quality of a high-toned sharper, you will not have to pay the taxes on mud, or the poor, or lanterns, to which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> are subject."</p>
<p>"So be it," said the poet. "I agree. I am a vagabond, a thief, a sharper, a man of the knife, anything you please; and I am all that already, monsieur, King of Thunes, for I am a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosopher" property="schema:name">philosopher</span>; <i>et omnia in philosophia, omnes in philosopho continentur</i>,—all things are contained in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosophy</span>, all men in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosopher" property="schema:name">philosopher</span>, as you know."</p>
<p>The King of Thunes scowled.</p>
<p>"What do you take me for, my friend? What <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_the_Jews_in_Hungary" property="schema:name">Hungarian Jew</span> patter are you jabbering at us? I don't know <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hebrew_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Hebrew</span>. One isn't a Jew because one is a bandit. I don't even steal any longer. I'm above that; I kill. Cut-throat, yes; cutpurse, no."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> tried to slip in some excuse between these curt words, which wrath rendered more and more <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerky" property="schema:name">jerky</span>.</p>
<p>"I ask your pardon, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monsignor" property="schema:name">monseigneur</span>. It is not <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hebrew_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Hebrew</span>; 'tis <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span>."</p>
<p>"I tell you," resumed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span> angrily, "that I'm not a Jew, and that I'll have you hung, belly of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Synagogue" property="schema:name">synagogue</span>, like that little shopkeeper of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judea" property="schema:name">Judea</span>, who is by your side, and whom I entertain strong hopes of seeing nailed to a counter one of these days, like the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Counterfeit" property="schema:name">counterfeit</span> coin that he is!"</p>
<p>So saying, he pointed his finger at the little, bearded <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/History_of_the_Jews_in_Hungary" property="schema:name">Hungarian Jew</span> who had accosted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> with his <i>facitote caritatem</i>, and who, understanding no other language beheld with surprise the King of Thunes's ill-humor overflow upon him.</p>
<p>At length Monsieur <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span> calmed down.</p>
<p>"So you will be a vagabond, you knave?" he said to our poet.</p>
<p>"Of course," replied the poet.</p>
<p>"Willing is not all," said the surly <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>; "good will doesn't put one <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Onion" property="schema:name">onion</span> the more into the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soup" property="schema:name">soup</span>, and 'tis good for nothing except to go to Paradise with; now, Paradise and the thieves' band are two different things. In order to be received among the thieves,* you must prove that you are good for something, and for that purpose, you must search the manikin."</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     * L'argot.<br/></div>
<p>"I'll search anything you like," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span> made a sign. Several thieves detached themselves from the circle, and returned a moment later. They brought two thick posts, terminated at their lower extremities in spreading timber supports, which made them stand readily upon the ground; to the upper extremity of the two posts they fitted a cross-beam, and the whole constituted a very pretty portable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span>, which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> had the satisfaction of beholding rise before him, in a twinkling. Nothing was lacking, not even the rope, which swung gracefully over the cross-beam.</p>
<p>"What are they going to do?" <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> asked himself with some uneasiness. A sound of bells, which he heard at that moment, put an end to his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anxiety" property="schema:name">anxiety</span>; it was a stuffed manikin, which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span> were suspending by the neck from the rope, a sort of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scarecrow" property="schema:name">scarecrow</span> dressed in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span>, and so hung with mule-bells and larger bells, that one might have tricked out thirty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spanish_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Castilian</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mule" property="schema:name">mules</span> with them. These thousand tiny bells quivered for some time with the vibration of the rope, then gradually died away, and finally became <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span> when the manikin had been brought into a state of immobility by that law of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pendulum" property="schema:name">pendulum</span> which has dethroned the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Water_clock" property="schema:name">water clock</span> and the hour-glass. Then <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>, pointing out to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> a rickety old stool placed beneath the manikin,—"Climb up there."</p>
<p>"Death of the devil!" objected <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>; "I shall break my neck. Your stool limps like one of Martial's distiches; it has one <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hexameter" property="schema:name">hexameter</span> leg and one <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iambic_pentameter" property="schema:name">pentameter</span> leg."</p>
<p>"Climb!" repeated <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> mounted the stool, and succeeded, not without some oscillations of head and arms, in regaining his centre of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gravitation" property="schema:name">gravity</span>.</p>
<p>"Now," went on the King of Thunes, "twist your right foot round your left leg, and rise on the tip of your left foot."</p>
<p>"Monseigneur," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "so you absolutely insist on my breaking some one of my limbs?"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span> tossed his head.</p>
<p>"Hark ye, my friend, you talk too much. Here's the gist of the matter in two words: you are to rise on tiptoe, as I tell you; in that way you will be able to reach the pocket of the manikin, you will rummage it, you will pull out the purse that is there,—and if you do all this without our hearing the sound of a bell, all is well: you shall be a vagabond. All we shall then have to do, will be to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thrash_metal" property="schema:name">thrash</span> you soundly for the space of a week."</p>
<p>"<i>Ventre-Dieu</i>! I will be careful," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>. "And suppose I do make the bells sound?"</p>
<p>"Then you will be hanged. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"I don't understand at all," replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p>"Listen, once more. You are to search the manikin, and take away its purse; if a single bell stirs during the operation, you will be hung. Do you understand that?"</p>
<p>"Good," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>; "I understand that. And then?"</p>
<p>"If you succeed in removing the purse without our hearing the bells, you are a vagabond, and you will be thrashed for eight consecutive days. You understand now, no doubt?"</p>
<p>"No, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monsignor" property="schema:name">monseigneur</span>; I no longer understand. Where is the advantage to me? hanged in one case, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Club_(weapon)" property="schema:name">cudgelled</span> in the other?"</p>
<p>"And a vagabond," resumed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>, "and a vagabond; is that nothing? It is for your interest that we should beat you, in order to harden you to blows."</p>
<p>"Many thanks," replied the poet.</p>
<p>"Come, make haste," said the king, stamping upon his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barrel" property="schema:name">cask</span>, which resounded like a huge drum! "Search the manikin, and let there be an end to this! I warn you for the last time, that if I hear a single bell, you will take the place of the manikin."</p>
<p>The band of thieves applauded <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>'s words, and arranged themselves in a circle round the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span>, with a laugh so pitiless that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> perceived that he amused them too much not to have everything to fear from them. No hope was left for him, accordingly, unless it were the slight chance of succeeding in the formidable operation which was imposed upon him; he decided to risk it, but it was not without first having addressed a fervent prayer to the manikin he was about to plunder, and who would have been easier to move to pity than the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span>. These myriad bells, with their little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copper" property="schema:name">copper</span> tongues, seemed to him like the mouths of so many <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asp_(reptile)" property="schema:name">asps</span>, open and ready to sting and to hiss.</p>
<p>"Oh!" he said, in a very low voice, "is it possible that my life depends on the slightest vibration of the least of these bells? Oh!" he added, with clasped hands, "bells, do not ring, hand-bells do not clang, mule-bells do not quiver!"</p>
<p>He made one more attempt upon Trouillefou.</p>
<p>"And if there should come a gust of wind?"</p>
<p>"You will be hanged," replied the other, without hesitation.</p>
<p>Perceiving that no respite, nor reprieve, nor subterfuge was possible, he bravely decided upon his course of action; he wound his right foot round his left leg, raised himself on his left foot, and stretched out his arm: but at the moment when his hand touched the manikin, his body, which was now supported upon one leg only, wavered on the stool which had but three; he made an involuntary effort to support himself by the manikin, lost his balance, and fell heavily to the ground, deafened by the fatal vibration of the thousand bells of the manikin, which, yielding to the impulse imparted by his hand, described first a rotary motion, and then swayed majestically between the two posts.</p>
<p>"Malediction!" he cried as he fell, and remained as though dead, with his face to the earth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he heard the dreadful <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">peal</span> above his head, the diabolical laughter of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span>, and the voice of Trouillefou saying,—</p>
<p>"Pick me up that knave, and hang him without ceremony." He rose. They had already detached the manikin to make room for him.</p>
<p>The thieves made him mount the stool, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span> came to him, passed the rope about his neck, and, tapping him on the shoulder,—</p>
<p>"Adieu, my friend. You can't escape now, even if you digested with the pope's guts."</p>
<p>The word "Mercy!" died away upon <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>'s lips. He cast his eyes about him; but there was no hope: all were laughing.</p>
<p>"Bellevigne de l'Etoile," said the King of Thunes to an enormous vagabond, who stepped out from the ranks, "climb upon the cross beam."</p>
<p>Bellevigne de l'Etoile nimbly mounted the transverse beam, and in another minute, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, on raising his eyes, beheld him, with terror, seated upon the beam above his head.</p>
<p>"Now," resumed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span>, "as soon as I clap my hands, you, Andry the Red, will fling the stool to the ground with a blow of your knee; you, François Chante-Prune, will cling to the feet of the rascal; and you, Bellevigne, will fling yourself on his shoulders; and all three at once, do you hear?"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> shuddered.</p>
<p>"Are you ready?" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span> to the three thieves, who held themselves in readiness to fall upon <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>. A moment of horrible suspense ensued for the poor victim, during which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span> tranquilly thrust into the fire with the tip of his foot, some bits of vine shoots which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire" property="schema:name">flame</span> had not caught. "Are you ready?" he repeated, and opened his hands to clap. One second more and all would have been over.</p>
<p>But he paused, as though struck by a sudden thought.</p>
<p>"One moment!" said he; "I forgot! It is our custom not to hang a man without inquiring whether there is any woman who wants him. Comrade, this is your last resource. You must wed either a female vagabond or the noose."</p>
<p>This law of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span>, singular as it may strike the reader, remains to-day written out at length, in ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">English</span> legislation. (See <i>Burington's Observations</i>.)</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> breathed again. This was the second time that he had returned to life within an hour. So he did not dare to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trust_law" property="schema:name">trust</span> to it too implicitly.</p>
<p>"Holà!" cried <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>, mounted once more upon his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barrel" property="schema:name">cask</span>, "holà! women, females, is there among you, from the sorceress to her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" property="schema:name">cat</span>, a wench who wants this rascal? Holà, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colette" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Colette</span> la Charonne! Elisabeth Trouvain! Simone Jodouyne! Marie Piédebou! Thonne la Longue! Bérarde Fanouel! Michelle Genaille! Claude Ronge-oreille! Mathurine Girorou!—Holà! Isabeau-la-Thierrye! Come and see! A man for nothing! Who wants him?"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, no doubt, was not very appetizing in this miserable condition. The female <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span> did not seem to be much affected by the proposition. The unhappy wretch heard them answer: "No! no! hang him; there'll be the more fun for us all!"</p>
<p>Nevertheless, three emerged from the throng and came to smell of him. The first was a big wench, with a square face. She examined the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span>'s deplorable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doublet_(clothing)" property="schema:name">doublet</span> attentively. His garment was worn, and more full of holes than a stove for roasting <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chestnut" property="schema:name">chestnuts</span>. The girl made a wry face. "Old rag!" she muttered, and addressing <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "Let's see your cloak!" "I have lost it," replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>. "Your hat?" "They took it away from me." "Your shoes?" "They have hardly any soles left." "Your purse?" "Alas!" stammered <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "I have not even a sou." "Let them hang you, then, and say 'Thank you!'" retorted the vagabond wench, turning her back on him.</p>
<p>The second,—old, black, wrinkled, hideous, with an ugliness conspicuous even in the Cour des Miracles, trotted round <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>. He almost trembled lest she should want him. But she mumbled between her teeth, "He's too thin," and went off.</p>
<p>The third was a young girl, quite fresh, and not too ugly. "Save me!" said the poor fellow to her, in a low tone. She gazed at him for a moment with an air of pity, then dropped her eyes, made a plait in her petticoat, and remained in indecision. He followed all these movements with his eyes; it was the last gleam of hope. "No," said the young girl, at length, "no! Guillaume Longuejoue would beat me." She retreated into the crowd.</p>
<p>"You are unlucky, comrade," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>.</p>
<p>Then rising to his feet, upon his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hogshead" property="schema:name">hogshead</span>. "No one wants him," he exclaimed, imitating the accent of an auctioneer, to the great delight of all; "no one wants him? once, twice, three times!" and, turning towards the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span> with a sign of his hand, "Gone!"</p>
<p>Bellevigne de l'Etoile, Andry the Red, François Chante-Prune, stepped up to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p>At that moment a cry arose among the thieves: "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">La Esmeralda</span>! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">La Esmeralda</span>!"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> shuddered, and turned towards the side whence the clamor proceeded.</p>
<p>The crowd opened, and gave passage to a pure and dazzling form.</p>
<p>It was the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">La Esmeralda</span>!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stupefied" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">stupefied</span> in the midst of his emotions, by the abrupt manner in which that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span> word knotted together all his reminiscences of the day.</p>
<p>This rare creature seemed, even in the Cour des Miracles, to exercise her sway of charm and beauty. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span>, male and female, ranged themselves gently along her path, and their brutal faces beamed beneath her glance.</p>
<p>She approached the victim with her light step. Her pretty Djali followed her. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> was more dead than alive. She examined him for a moment in silence.</p>
<p>"You are going to hang this man?" she said gravely, to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>.</p>
<p>"Yes, sister," replied the King of Thunes, "unless you will take him for your husband."</p>
<p>She made her pretty little pout with her under <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lip" property="schema:name">lip</span>. "I'll take him," said she.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> firmly believed that he had been in a dream ever since morning, and that this was the continuation of it.</p>
<p>The change was, in fact, violent, though a gratifying one. They undid the noose, and made the poet step down from the stool. His emotion was so lively that he was obliged to sit down.</p>
<p>The Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egypt</span> brought an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earthenware" property="schema:name">earthenware</span> crock, without uttering a word. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> offered it to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>: "Fling it on the ground," said she.</p>
<p>The crock broke into four pieces.</p>
<p>"Brother," then said the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egypt</span>, laying his hands upon their foreheads, "she is your wife; sister, he is your husband for four years. Go."</p>
