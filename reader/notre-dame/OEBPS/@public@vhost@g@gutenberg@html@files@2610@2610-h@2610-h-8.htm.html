<body prefix="schema: http://schema.org/"><div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">   *The book is about to kill the edifice*.<br/></div>
<p>The invention of printing is the greatest event in history. It is the mother of revolution. It is the mode of expression of humanity which is totally renewed; it is human thought stripping off one form and donning another; it is the complete and definitive change of skin of that symbolical <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serpent_(symbolism)" property="schema:name">serpent</span> which since the days of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adam_and_Eve" property="schema:name">Adam</span> has represented intelligence.</p>
<p>In its printed form, thought is more imperishable than ever; it is volatile, irresistible, indestructible. It is mingled with the air. In the days of architecture it made a mountain of itself, and took powerful possession of a century and a place. Now it converts itself into a flock of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">birds</span>, scatters itself to the four winds, and occupies all points of air and space at once.</p>
<p>We repeat, who does not perceive that in this form it is far more indelible? It was solid, it has become alive. It passes from duration in time to immortality. One can demolish a mass; how can one extirpate ubiquity? If a flood comes, the mountains will have long disappeared beneath the waves, while the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">birds</span> will still be flying about; and if a single ark <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buoyancy" property="schema:name">floats</span> on the surface of the cataclysm, they will alight upon it, will float with it, will be present with it at the ebbing of the waters; and the new world which emerges from this chaos will behold, on its awakening, the thought of the world which has been submerged soaring above it, winged and living.</p>
<p>And when one observes that this mode of expression is not only the most conservative, but also the most simple, the most convenient, the most practicable for all; when one reflects that it does not <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drag_(physics)" property="schema:name">drag</span> after it bulky baggage, and does not set in motion a heavy apparatus; when one compares thought forced, in order to transform itself into an edifice, to put in motion four or five other arts and tons of gold, a whole mountain of stones, a whole forest of timber-work, a whole nation of workmen; when one compares it to the thought which becomes a book, and for which a little paper, a little ink, and a pen suffice,—how can one be surprised that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intelligence" property="schema:name">human intelligence</span> should have quitted architecture for printing? Cut the primitive bed of a river abruptly with a canal hollowed out below its level, and the river will <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Desert" property="schema:name">desert</span> its bed.</p>
<p>Behold how, beginning with the discovery of printing, architecture withers away little by little, becomes lifeless and bare. How one feels the water sinking, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plant_sap" property="schema:name">sap</span> departing, the thought of the times and of the people withdrawing from it! The chill is almost imperceptible in the fifteenth century; the press is, as yet, too weak, and, at the most, draws from powerful architecture a superabundance of life. But practically beginning with the sixteenth century, the malady of architecture is visible; it is no longer the expression of society; it becomes classic art in a miserable manner; from being Gallic, European, indigenous, it becomes <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Greek</span> and Roman; from being true and modern, it becomes pseudo-classic. It is this decadence which is called the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance" property="schema:name">Renaissance</span>. A magnificent decadence, however, for the ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> genius, that sun which sets behind the gigantic press of Mayence, still penetrates for a while longer with its rays that whole <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hybrid_(biology)" property="schema:name">hybrid</span> pile of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arcade_(architecture)" property="schema:name">arcades</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corinthian_order" property="schema:name">Corinthian columns</span>.</p>
<p>It is that setting sun which we mistake for the dawn.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, from the moment when architecture is no longer anything but an art like any other; as soon as it is no longer the total art, the sovereign art, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyrant" property="schema:name">tyrant</span> art,—it has no longer the power to retain the other arts. So they emancipate themselves, break the yoke of the architect, and take themselves off, each one in its own direction. Each one of them gains by this divorce. Isolation aggrandizes everything. Sculpture becomes statuary, the image trade becomes painting, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canon_law" property="schema:name">canon</span> becomes music. One would pronounce it an empire dismembered at the death of its Alexander, and whose provinces become kingdoms.</p>
<p>Hence <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raphael" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Raphael</span>, Michael Angelo, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_Goujon" property="schema:name">Jean Goujon</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giovanni_Pierluigi_da_Palestrina" property="schema:name">Palestrina</span>, those splendors of the dazzling sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Thought emancipates itself in all directions at the same time as the arts. The arch-heretics of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span> had already made large incisions into <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catholicism" property="schema:name">Catholicism</span>. The sixteenth <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Century_break" property="schema:name">century breaks</span> religious unity. Before the invention of printing, reform would have been merely a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protestant_Reformation" property="schema:name">schism</span>; printing converted it into a revolution. Take away the press; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heresy" property="schema:name">heresy</span> is enervated. Whether it be <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_providence" property="schema:name">Providence</span> or Fate, Gutenburg is the precursor of Luther.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when the sun of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span> is completely set, when the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> genius is forever extinct upon the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horus" property="schema:name">horizon</span>, architecture grows dim, loses its color, becomes more and more effaced. The printed book, the gnawing worm of the edifice, sucks and devours it. It becomes bare, denuded of its foliage, and grows visibly emaciated. It is petty, it is poor, it is nothing. It no longer expresses anything, not even the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span> of the art of another time. Reduced to itself, abandoned by the other arts, because human thought is abandoning it, it summons bunglers in place of artists. Glass replaces the painted windows. The stone-cutter succeeds the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sculpture" property="schema:name">sculptor</span>. Farewell all <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plant_sap" property="schema:name">sap</span>, all originality, all life, all intelligence. It drags along, a lamentable workshop <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mendicant_orders" property="schema:name">mendicant</span>, from copy to copy. Michael Angelo, who, no doubt, felt even in the sixteenth century that it was dying, had a last idea, an idea of despair. That <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Titan_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Titan</span> of art piled the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pantheon,_Rome" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Pantheon</span> on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parthenon" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Parthenon</span>, and made Saint-Peter's at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Rome</span>. A great work, which deserved to remain unique, the last originality of architecture, the signature of a giant artist at the bottom of the colossal register of stone which was closed forever. With Michael Angelo dead, what does this miserable architecture, which survived itself in the state of a spectre, do? It takes Saint-Peter in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Rome</span>, copies it and parodies it. It is a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mania" property="schema:name">mania</span>. It is a pity. Each century has its Saint-Peter's of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Rome</span>; in the seventeenth century, the Val-de-Grâce; in the eighteenth, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Panthéon,_Paris" property="schema:name">Sainte-Geneviève</span>. Each country has its Saint-Peter's of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Rome</span>. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">London</span> has one; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Petersburg" typeof="schema:AdministrativeArea" property="schema:name">Petersburg</span> has another; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> has two or three. The insignificant testament, the last dotage of a decrepit grand art falling back into infancy before it dies.</p>
<p>If, in place of the characteristic monuments which we have just described, we examine the general aspect of art from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, we notice the same phenomena of decay and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tuberculosis" property="schema:name">phthisis</span>. Beginning with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_II_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">François II</span>., the architectural form of the edifice effaces itself more and more, and allows the geometrical form, like the bony structure of an emaciated invalid, to become prominent. The fine lines of art give way to the cold and inexorable lines of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geometry" property="schema:name">geometry</span>. An edifice is no longer an edifice; it is a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polyhedron" property="schema:name">polyhedron</span>. Meanwhile, architecture is tormented in her struggles to conceal this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nudity" property="schema:name">nudity</span>. Look at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Greek</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pediment" property="schema:name">pediment</span> inscribed upon the Roman <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pediment" property="schema:name">pediment</span>, and vice versa. It is still the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pantheon,_Rome" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Pantheon</span> on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parthenon" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Parthenon</span>: Saint-Peter's of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Rome</span>. Here are the brick houses of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_IV_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Henri IV</span>., with their stone corners; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Place_des_Vosges" property="schema:name">Place Royale</span>, the Place Dauphine. Here are the churches of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIII_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XIII</span>., heavy, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Squatting" property="schema:name">squat</span>, thickset, crowded together, loaded with a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dome" property="schema:name">dome</span> like a hump. Here is the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_Mazarin" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Mazarin</span> architecture, the wretched <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Italian</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pasticcio" property="schema:name">pasticcio</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Six_Nations_Championship" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">Four Nations</span>. Here are the palaces of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XIV</span>., long barracks for courtiers, stiff, cold, tiresome. Here, finally, is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XV_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XV</span>., with chiccory leaves and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vermicelli" property="schema:name">vermicelli</span>, and all the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wart" property="schema:name">warts</span>, and all the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fungus" property="schema:name">fungi</span>, which disfigure that decrepit, toothless, and coquettish old architecture. From <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_II_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">François II</span>. to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XV_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XV</span>., the evil has increased in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geometric_progression" property="schema:name">geometrical progression</span>. Art has no longer anything but skin upon its bones. It is miserably perishing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile what becomes of printing? All the life which is leaving architecture comes to it. In proportion as architecture ebbs, printing swells and grows. That capital of forces which human thought had been expending in edifices, it henceforth expends in books. Thus, from the sixteenth century onward, the press, raised to the level of decaying architecture, contends with it and kills it. In the seventeenth century it is already sufficiently the sovereign, sufficiently triumphant, sufficiently established in its victory, to give to the world the feast of a great literary century. In the eighteenth, having reposed for a long time at the Court of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XIV</span>., it seizes again the old sword of Luther, puts it into the hand of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voltaire" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Voltaire</span>, and rushes impetuously to the attack of that ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Europe</span>, whose architectural expression it has already killed. At the moment when the eighteenth century comes to an end, it has destroyed everything. In the nineteenth, it begins to reconstruct.</p>
<p>Now, we ask, which of the three arts has really represented human thought for the last three centuries? which translates it? which expresses not only its literary and scholastic vagaries, but its vast, profound, universal movement? which constantly superposes itself, without a break, without a gap, upon the human race, which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" property="schema:name">walks</span> a monster with a thousand legs?—Architecture or printing?</p>
<p>It is printing. Let the reader make no mistake; architecture is dead; irretrievably slain by the printed book,—slain because it endures for a shorter time,—slain because it costs more. Every cathedral represents millions. Let the reader now imagine what an investment of funds it would require to rewrite the architectural book; to cause thousands of edifices to swarm once more upon the soil; to return to those epochs when the throng of monuments was such, according to the statement of an eye witness, "that one would have said that the world in shaking itself, had cast off its old garments in order to cover itself with a white vesture of churches." <i>Erat enim ut si mundus, ipse excutiendo semet, rejecta vetustate, candida ecclesiarum vestem indueret</i>. (GLABER RADOLPHUS.)</p>
<p>A book is so soon made, costs so little, and can go so far! How can it surprise us that all human thought flows in this channel? This does not mean that architecture will not still have a fine monument, an isolated masterpiece, here and there. We may still have from time to time, under the reign of printing, a column made I suppose, by a whole army from melted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cannon" property="schema:name">cannon</span>, as we had under the reign of architecture, Iliads and Romanceros, Mahabâhrata, and Nibelungen Lieds, made by a whole people, with rhapsodies piled up and melted together. The great accident of an architect of ge<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/SoFly_and_Nius" property="schema:name">nius</span> may happen in the twentieth century, like that of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dante_Alighieri" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Dante</span> in the thirteenth. But architecture will no longer be the social art, the collective art, the dominating art. The grand poem, the grand edifice, the grand work of humanity will no longer be built: it will be printed.</p>
<p>And henceforth, if architecture should arise again accidentally, it will no longer be mistress. It will be subservient to the law of literature, which formerly received the law from it. The respective positions of the two arts will be inverted. It is certain that in architectural epochs, the poems, rare it is true, resemble the monuments. In <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/India" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">India</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vyasa" property="schema:name">Vyasa</span> is branching, strange, impenetrable as a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stupa" property="schema:name">pagoda</span>. In <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egyptian</span> Orient, poetry has like the edifices, grandeur and tranquillity of line; in antique <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece" property="schema:name">Greece</span>, beauty, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serenity_(film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">serenity</span>, calm; in Christian <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Europe</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catholic_Church" property="schema:name">Catholic</span> majesty, the popular naivete, the rich and luxuriant vegetation of an epoch of renewal. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bible" property="schema:name">Bible</span> resembles the Pyramids; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iliad" property="schema:name">Iliad</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parthenon" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Parthenon</span>; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Homer</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phidias" property="schema:name">Phidias</span>. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dante_Alighieri" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Dante</span> in the thirteenth century is the last <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque</span> church; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Shakespeare" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Shakespeare</span> in the sixteenth, the last <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> cathedral.</p>
<p>Thus, to sum up what we have hitherto said, in a fashion which is necessarily incomplete and mutilated, the human race has two books, two registers, two testaments: masonry and printing; the Bible of stone and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bible" property="schema:name">Bible</span> of paper. No doubt, when one contemplates these two <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bible" property="schema:name">Bible</span>s, laid so broadly open in the centuries, it is permissible to regret the visible majesty of the writing of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Granite" property="schema:name">granite</span>, those gigantic alphabets formulated in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonnade" property="schema:name">colonnades</span>, in pylons, in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Obelisk" property="schema:name">obelisks</span>, those sorts of human mountains which cover the world and the past, from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyramid" property="schema:name">pyramid</span> to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell tower</span>, from Cheops to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strasbourg" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Strasburg</span>. The past must be reread upon these pages of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span>. This book, written by architecture, must be admired and perused incessantly; but the grandeur of the edifice which printing erects in its turn must not be denied.</p>
<p>That edifice is colossal. Some compiler of statistics has calculated, that if all the volumes which have issued from the press since Gutenberg's day were to be piled one upon another, they would fill the space between the earth and the moon; but it is not that sort of grandeur of which we wished to speak. Nevertheless, when one tries to collect in one's mind a comprehensive image of the total products of printing down to our own days, does not that total appear to us like an immense construction, resting upon the entire world, at which humanity toils without relaxation, and whose monstrous crest is lost in the profound mists of the future? It is the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ant_colony" property="schema:name">anthill</span> of intelligence. It is the hive whither come all imaginations, those golden bees, with their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Honey" property="schema:name">honey</span>.</p>
<p>The edifice has a thousand stories. Here and there one beholds on its staircases the gloomy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cave" property="schema:name">caverns</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span> which pierce its interior. Everywhere upon its surface, art causes its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabesque_(Islamic_art)" property="schema:name">arabesques</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rose_window" property="schema:name">rosettes</span>, and laces to thrive luxuriantly before the eyes. There, every individual work, however capricious and isolated it may seem, has its place and its projection. Harmony results from the whole. From the cathedral of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Shakespeare" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Shakespeare</span> to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mosque" property="schema:name">mosque</span> of Byron, a thousand tiny bell towers are piled pell-mell above this metropolis of universal thought. At its base are written some ancient titles of humanity which architecture had not registered. To the left of the entrance has been fixed the ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Relief" property="schema:name">bas-relief</span>, in white <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span>, of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Homer</span>; to the right, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polyglot_(book)" property="schema:name">polyglot Bible</span> rears its seven heads. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lernaean_Hydra" property="schema:name">hydra</span> of the Romancero and some other <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hybrid_(biology)" property="schema:name">hybrid</span> forms, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vedas" property="schema:name">Vedas</span> and the Nibelungen bristle further on.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the prodigious edifice still remains incomplete. The press, that giant machine, which incessantly pumps all the intellectual <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plant_sap" property="schema:name">sap</span> of society, belches forth without pause fresh materials for its work. The whole human race is on the scaffoldings. Each mind is a mason. The humblest fills his hole, or places his stone. Retif dè le <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breton_people" property="schema:name">Bretonne</span> brings his hod of plaster. Every day a new course rises. Independently of the original and individual contribution of each writer, there are collective contingents. The eighteenth century gives the <i>Encyclopedia</i>, the revolution gives the <i>Moniteur</i>. Assuredly, it is a construction which increases and piles up in endless spirals; there also are confusion of tongues, incessant activity, indefatigable labor, eager competition of all humanity, refuge promised to intelligence, a new Flood against an overflow of barbarians. It is the second tow<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/ER_(TV_series)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">er</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon" property="schema:name">Babel</span> of the human race.</p>

<p>A very happy personage in the year of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_grace" property="schema:name">grace</span> 1482, was the noble gentleman Robert d'Estouteville, chevalier, Sieur de Beyne, Baron d'Ivry and Saint Andry en la <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/County_of_La_Marche" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Marche</span>, counsellor and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chamberlain_(office)" property="schema:name">chamberlain</span> to the king, and guard of the provostship of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>.

A marvellous thing in '82 was a gentleman bearing the king's commission, and whose letters of institution ran back to the epoch of the marriage of the natural daughter of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. with Monsieur the Bastard of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Bourbon" property="schema:name">Bourbon</span>.</p>

<p>The same day on which Robert d'Estouteville took the place of Jacques de Villiers in the provostship of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, Master Jehan Dauvet replaced Messire Helye de Thorrettes in the first presidency of the Court of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parliament_of_England" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">Parliament</span>, Jehan Jouvenel des Ursins supplanted Pierre de Morvilliers in the office of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord_Chancellor_of_France" property="schema:name">chancellor</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>, Regnault des Dormans ousted Pierre Puy from the charge of master of requests in ordinary of the king's household. Now, upon how many heads had the presidency, the chancellorship, the mastership passed since Robert d'Estouteville had held the provostship of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. It had been "granted to him for safekeeping," as the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Letters_patent" property="schema:name">letters patent</span> said; and certainly he kept it well. He had clung to it, he had incorporated himself with it, he had so identified himself with it that he had escaped that fury for change which possessed Louis XI., a tormenting and industrious king, whose policy it was to maintain the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Price_elasticity_of_demand" property="schema:name">elasticity</span> of his power by frequent appointments and revocations. More than this; the brave chevalier had obtained the reversion of the office for his son, and for two years already, the name of the noble man Jacques d'Estouteville, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Equerry" property="schema:name">equerry</span>, had figured beside his at the head of the register of the salary list of the provostship of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. A rare and notable favor indeed! It is true that Robert d'Estouteville was a good soldier, that he had loyally raised his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennon" property="schema:name">pennon</span> against "the league of public good," and that he had presented to the queen a very marvellous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deer" property="schema:name">stag</span> in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Confectionery" property="schema:name">confectionery</span> on the day of her entrance to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> in 14... Moreover, he possessed the good friendship of Messire Tristan l'Hermite, provost of the marshals of the king's household. Hence a very sweet and pleasant existence was that of Messire Robert. In the first place, very good wages, to which were attached, and from which hung, like extra bunches of grapes on his vine, the revenues of the civil and criminal registries of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(religion)" property="schema:name">provost</span>ship, plus the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_poetry" property="schema:name">ci</span>vil and criminal revenues of the tribunals of Embas of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Châtelet</span>, without reckoning some little toll from the bridges of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantes-la-Jolie" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Mantes</span> and of Corbeil, and the profits on the craft of Shagreen-makers of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, on the corders of firewood and the measurers of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salt" property="schema:name">salt</span>. Add to this the pleasure of displaying himself in rides about the city, and of making his fine military costume, which you may still admire sculptured on his tomb in the abbey of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_Jackie_Chan_Adventures_characters" property="schema:name">Valmont</span> in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Normandy" property="schema:name">Normandy</span>, and his morion, all embossed at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montlhéry" property="schema:name">Montlhéry</span>, stand out a contrast against the parti-colored <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tawny_(color)" property="schema:name">tawny</span> robes of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alderman" property="schema:name">aldermen</span> and police. And then, was it nothing to wield absolute supremacy over the sergeants of the police, the porter and watch of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Châtelet</span>, the two auditors of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Châtelet</span>, <i>auditores castelleti</i>, the sixteen commissioners of the sixteen quarters, the jailer of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Châtelet</span>, the four enfeoffed sergeants, the hundred and twenty mounted sergeants, with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mace_(club)" property="schema:name">maces</span>, the chevalier of the watch with his watch, his sub-watch, his counter-watch and his rear-watch? Was it nothing to exercise high and low justice, the right to interrogate, to hang and to draw, without reckoning petty jurisdiction in the first resort (<i>in prima instantia</i>, as the charters say), on that viscomty of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, so nobly appanaged with seven noble <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiwick" property="schema:name">bailiwicks</span>? Can anything sweeter be imagined than rendering judgments and decisions, as Messire Robert d'Estouteville daily did in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Grand Châtelet</span>, under the large and flattened arches of Philip Augustus? and going, as he was wont to do every evening, to that charming house situated in the Rue <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galilee" property="schema:name">Galilee</span>, in the enclosure of the royal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace_of_Versailles" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">palace</span>, which he held in right of his wife, Madame Ambroise de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folklore" property="schema:name">Lore</span>, to repose after the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fatigue_(material)" property="schema:name">fatigue</span> of having sent some poor wretch to pass the night in "that little cell of the Rue de Escorcherie, which the provosts and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alderman" property="schema:name">aldermen</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> used to make their prison; the same being eleven feet long, seven feet and four inches wide, and eleven feet high?"*</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  Comptes du domaine, 1383.<br/></div>
<p>And not only had Messire Robert d'Estouteville his special court as <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viscount" property="schema:name">vicomte</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>; but in addition he had a share, both for eye and tooth, in the grand court of the king. There was no head in the least elevated which had not passed through his hands before it came to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Executioner" property="schema:name">headsman</span>. It was he who went to seek M. de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nemours" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Nemours</span> at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution" property="schema:name">Bastille</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_ship_Saint_Antoine_(1800)" property="schema:name">Saint Antoine</span>, in order to conduct him to the Halles; and to conduct to the Grève M. de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Pol</span>, who clamored and resisted, to the great joy of the provost, who did not love monsieur the constable.</p>
<p>Here, assuredly, is more than sufficient to render a life happy and illustrious, and to deserve some day a notable page in that interesting history of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span>s of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, where one learns that Oudard de Villeneuve had a house in the Rue des Boucheries, that Guillaume de Hangest purchased the great and the little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savoy" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Savoy</span>, that Guillaume Thiboust gave the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nun" property="schema:name">nuns</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Panthéon,_Paris" property="schema:name">Sainte-Geneviève</span> his houses in the Rue <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>, that Hugues Aubriot lived in the Hôtel du Pore-Epic, and other domestic facts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, with so many reasons for taking life patiently and joyously, Messire Robert d'Estouteville woke up on the morning of the seventh of January, 1482, in a very surly and peevish mood. Whence came this ill temper? He could not have told himself. Was it because the sky was gray? or was the buckle of his old belt of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montlhéry" property="schema:name">Montlhéry</span> badly fastened, so that it confined his provostal portliness too closely? had he beheld ribald fellows, marching in bands of four, beneath his window, and setting him at defiance, in doublets but no shirts, hats without crowns, with wallet and bottle at their side? Was it a vague presentiment of the three hundred and seventy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_livre" property="schema:name">livres</span>, sixteen sous, eight farthings, which the future <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_VII_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">King Charles VII</span>. was to cut off from the provostship in the following year? The reader can take his choice; we, for our part, are much inclined to believe that he was in a bad humor, simply because he was in a bad humor.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was the day after a festival, a tiresome day for every one, and above all for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magistrate" property="schema:name">magistrate</span> who is charged with sweeping away all the filth, properly and figuratively speaking, which a festival day produces in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. And then he had to hold a sitting at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Grand Châtelet</span>. Now, we have noticed that judges in general so arrange matters that their day of audience shall also be their day of bad humor, so that they may always have some one upon whom to vent it conveniently, in the name of the king, law, and justice.</p>
<p>However, the audience had begun without him. His lieutenants, civil, criminal, and private, were doing his work, according to usage; and from eight o'clock in the morning, some scores of bourgeois and <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span>es</i>, heaped and crowded into an obscure corner of the audience chamber of Embas du <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Châtelet</span>, between a stout oaken barrier and the wall, had been gazing blissfully at the varied and cheerful spectacle of civil and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Criminal_justice" property="schema:name">criminal justice</span> dispensed by Master Florian Barbedienne, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" property="schema:name">auditor</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Châtelet</span>, lieutenant of monsieur the provost, in a somewhat confused and utterly haphazard manner.</p>
<p>The hall was small, low, vaulted. A table studded with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">fleurs-de-lis</span> stood at one end, with a large arm-chair of carved oak, which belonged to the provost and was empty, and a stool on the left for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" property="schema:name">auditor</span>, Master Florian. Below sat the clerk of the court, scribbling; opposite was the populace; and in front of the door, and in front of the table were many sergeants of the provostship in sleeveless jackets of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violet_(color)" property="schema:name">violet</span> camlet, with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/White_Crosses_(album)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">white crosses</span>. Two sergeants of the Parloir-aux-Bourgeois, clothed in their jackets of Toussaint, half <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span>, half blue, were posted as sentinels before a low, closed door, which was visible at the extremity of the hall, behind the table. A single pointed window, narrowly encased in the thick wall, illuminated with a pale ray of January sun two grotesque figures,—the capricious demon of stone carved as a tail-piece in the keystone of the vaulted ceiling, and the judge seated at the end of the hall on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">fleurs-de-lis</span>.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imagine_(song)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">Imagine</span>, in fact, at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(religion)" property="schema:name">provost</span>'s table, leaning upon his elbows between two bundles of documents of cases, with his foot on the train of his robe of plain brown cloth, his face buried in his hood of white lamb's skin, of which his brows seemed to be of a piece, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red_hair" property="schema:name">red</span>, crabbed, winking, bearing majestically the load of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fat" property="schema:name">fat</span> on his cheeks which met under his chin, Master Florian Barbedienne, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" property="schema:name">auditor</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Châtelet</span>.</p>
<p>Now, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" property="schema:name">auditor</span> was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>. A slight defect in an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" property="schema:name">auditor</span>. Master Florian delivered judgment, none the less, without appeal and very suitably. It is certainly quite sufficient for a judge to have the air of listening; and the venerable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" property="schema:name">auditor</span> fulfilled this condition, the sole one in justice, all the better because his attention could not be distracted by any noise.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had in the audience, a pitiless censor of his deeds and gestures, in the person of our friend <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Jehan Frollo</span> du Moulin, that little student of yesterday, that "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baby_transport" property="schema:name">stroller</span>," whom one was sure of encountering all over <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, anywhere except before the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rostrum_(anatomy)" property="schema:name">rostrums</span> of the professors.</p>
<p>"Stay," he said in a low tone to his companion, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Hood" property="schema:name">Robin</span> Poussepain, who was grinning at his side, while he was making his comments on the scenes which were being unfolded before his eyes, "yonder is Jehanneton du Buisson. The beautiful daughter of the lazy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">dog</span> at the Marché-Neuf!—Upon my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, he is condemning her, the old rascal! he has no more eyes than ears.

'Tis <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>!"</p>
<p>It was he indeed.</p>
<p>It was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, bound, encircled, roped, pinioned, and under good guard. The squad of policemen who surrounded him was assisted by the chevalier of the watch in person, wearing the arms of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span> embroidered on his breast, and the arms of the city on his back. There was nothing, however, about <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, except his deformity, which could justify the display of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Halberd" property="schema:name">halberds</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arquebus" property="schema:name">arquebuses</span>; he was gloomy, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span>, and tranquil. Only now and then did his single eye cast a sly and wrathful glance upon the bonds with which he was loaded.</p>
<p>He cast the same glance about him, but it was so dull and sleepy that the women only pointed him out to each other in derision.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Master Florian, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" property="schema:name">auditor</span>, turned over attentively the document in the complaint entered against <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, which the clerk handed him, and, having thus glanced at it, appeared to reflect for a moment. Thanks to this precaution, which he always was careful to take at the moment when on the point of beginning an examination, he knew beforehand the names, titles, and misdeeds of the accused, made cut and dried responses to questions foreseen, and succeeded in extricating himself from all the windings of the interrogation without allowing his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deafness</span> to be too apparent. The written charges were to him what the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">dog</span> is to the blind man. If his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deafness</span> did happen to betray him here and there, by some incoherent apostrophe or some unintelligible question, it passed for profundity with some, and for imbecility with others. In neither case did the honor of the magistracy sustain any injury; for it is far better that a judge should be reputed imbecile or profound than <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>. Hence he took great care to conceal his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deafness</span> from the eyes of all, and he generally succeeded so well that he had reached the point of deluding himself, which is, by the way, easier than is supposed. All <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kyphosis" property="schema:name">hunchbacks</span> walk with their heads held high, all stutterers harangue, all <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> people speak low. As for him, he believed, at the most, that his ear was a little refractory. It was the sole concession which he made on this point to public opinion, in his moments of frankness and examination of his conscience.</p>
<p>Having, then, thoroughly ruminated <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>'s affair, he threw back his head and half closed his eyes, for the sake of more majesty and impartiality, so that, at that moment, he was both <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> and blind. A double condition, without which no judge is perfect. It was in this magisterial attitude that he began the examination.</p>
<p>"Your name?"</p>
<p>Now this was a case which had not been "provided for by law," where a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man should be obliged to question a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, whom nothing warned that a question had been addressed to him, continued to stare intently at the judge, and made no reply. The judge, being <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>, and being in no way warned of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deafness</span> of the accused, thought that the latter had answered, as all accused do in general, and therefore he pursued, with his mechanical and stupid self-possession,—</p>
<p>"Very well. And your age?"</p>
<p>Again <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> made no reply to this question. The judge supposed that it had been replied to, and continued,—</p>
<p>"Now, your profession?"</p>
<p>Still the same silence. The spectators had begun, meanwhile, to whisper together, and to exchange glances.</p>
<p>"That will do," went on the imperturbable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" property="schema:name">auditor</span>, when he supposed that the accused had finished his third reply. "You are accused before us, <i>primo</i>, of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nocturnality" property="schema:name">nocturnal</span> disturbance; <i>secundo</i>, of a dishonorable act of violence upon the person of a foolish woman, <i>in proejudicium meretricis; tertio</i>, of rebellion and disloyalty towards the archers of the police of our lord, the king. Explain yourself upon all these points.—-Clerk, have you written down what the prisoner has said thus far?"</p>
<p>At this unlucky question, a burst of laughter rose from the clerk's table caught by the audience, so violent, so wild, so contagious, so universal, that the two <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> men were forced to perceive it. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> turned round, shrugging his hump with disdain, while Master Florian, equally astonished, and supposing that the laughter of the spectators had been provoked by some irreverent reply from the accused, rendered visible to him by that shrug of the shoulders, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apostrophe_(figure_of_speech)" property="schema:name">apostrophized</span> him indignantly,—</p>
<p>"You have uttered a reply, knave, which deserves the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Halterneck" property="schema:name">halter</span>. Do you know to whom you are speaking?"</p>
<p>This sally was not fitted to arrest the explosion of general merriment. It struck all as so whimsical, and so ridiculous, that the wild laughter even attacked the sergeants of the Parloi-aux-Bourgeois, a sort of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pike_(weapon)" property="schema:name">pikemen</span>, whose stupidity was part of their uniform. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> alone preserved his seriousness, for the good reason that he understood nothing of what was going on around him. The judge, more and more irritated, thought it his duty to continue in the same tone, hoping thereby to strike the accused with a terror which should react upon the audience, and bring it back to respect.</p>
<p>"So this is as much as to say, perverse and thieving knave that you are, that you permit yourself to be lacking in respect towards the Auditor of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Châtelet</span>, to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magistrate" property="schema:name">magistrate</span> committed to the popular police of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, charged with searching out crimes, delinquencies, and evil conduct; with controlling all trades, and interdicting monopoly; with maintaining the pavements; with debarring the hucksters of chickens, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poultry" property="schema:name">poultry</span>, and water-fowl; of superintending the measuring of fagots and other sorts of wood; of purging the city of mud, and the air of contagious maladies; in a word, with attending continually to public affairs, without wages or hope of salary! Do you know that I am called Florian Barbedienne, actual lieutenant to monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span>, and, moreover, commissioner, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inquisition" property="schema:name">inquisitor</span>, controller, and examiner, with equal power in provostship, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiwick" property="schema:name">bailiwick</span>, preservation, and inferior court of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judiciary" property="schema:name">judicature</span>?—"</p>
<p>There is no reason why a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man talking to a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man should stop. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> knows where and when Master Florian would have landed, when thus launched at full speed in lofty eloquence, if the low door at the extreme end of the room had not suddenly opened, and given entrance to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span> in person. At his entrance Master Florian did not stop short, but, making a half-turn on his heels, and aiming at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span> the harangue with which he had been withering <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> a moment before,—</p>
<p>"Monseigneur," said he, "I demand such penalty as you shall deem fitting against the prisoner here present, for grave and aggravated offence against the court."</p>
<p>And he seated himself, utterly <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathless_(1960_film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">breathless</span>, wiping away the great drops of sweat which fell from his brow and drenched, like tears, the parchments spread out before him. Messire Robert d'Estouteville frowned and made a gesture so imperious and significant to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man in some measure understood it.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span> addressed him with severity, "What have you done that you have been brought hither, knave?"</p>
<p>The poor fellow, supposing that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span> was asking his name, broke the silence which he habitually preserved, and replied, in a harsh and guttural voice, "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>."</p>
<p>The reply matched the question so little that the wild laugh began to circulate once more, and Messire Robert exclaimed, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> with wrath,—</p>
<p>"Are you mocking me also, you arrant knave?"</p>
<p>"Bellringer of Notre-Dame," replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, supposing that what was required of him was to explain to the judge who he was.</p>
<p>"Bellringer!" interpolated the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span>, who had waked up early enough to be in a sufficiently bad temper, as we have said, not to require to have his fury inflamed by such strange responses. "Bellringer! I'll play you a chime of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bacteria" property="schema:name">rods</span> on your back through the squares of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>! Do you hear, knave?"</p>
<p>"If it is my age that you wish to know," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, "I think that I shall be twenty at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_of_Tours" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint Martin</span>'s day."</p>
<p>This was too much; the provost could no longer restrain himself.</p>
<p>"Ah! you are scoffing at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span>ship, wretch! Messieurs the sergeants of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ceremonial_mace" property="schema:name">mace</span>, you will take me this knave to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span> of the Grève, you will flog him, and turn him for an hour. He shall pay me for it, <i>tête Dieu</i>! And I order that the present judgment shall be cried, with the assistance of four sworn trumpeters, in the seven <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castellan" property="schema:name">castellanies</span> of the viscomty of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>."</p>
<p>The clerk set to work incontinently to draw up the account of the sentence.</p>
<p>"<i>Ventre Dieu</i>! 'tis well adjudged!" cried the little scholar, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Jehan Frollo</span> du Moulin, from his corner.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span> turned and fixed his flashing eyes once more on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. "I believe the knave said '<i>Ventre Dieu</i>' Clerk, add twelve deniers Parisian for the oath, and let the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sacristy" property="schema:name">vestry</span> of Saint Eustache have the half of it; I have a particular devotion for Saint Eustache."</p>
<p>In a few minutes the sentence was drawn up. Its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tenor" property="schema:name">tenor</span> was simple and brief. The customs of the provostship and the viscomty had not yet been worked over by President Thibaut Baillet, and by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_II_of_Sicily" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Roger</span> Barmne, the king's advocate; they had not been obstructed, at that time, by that lofty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hedge" property="schema:name">hedge</span> of quibbles and procedures, which the two jurisconsults planted there at the beginning of the sixteenth century. All was clear, expeditious, explicit. One went straight to the point then, and at the end of every path there was immediately visible, without thickets and without turnings; the wheel, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span>, or the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>. One at least knew whither one was going.</p>
<p>The clerk presented the sentence to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span>, who affixed his seal to it, and departed to pursue his round of the audience hall, in a frame of mind which seemed destined to fill all the jails in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> that day. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Jehan Frollo</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Hood" property="schema:name">Robin</span> Poussepain laughed in their sleeves. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> gazed on the whole with an indifferent and astonished air.</p>
<p>However, at the moment when Master Florian Barbedienne was reading the sentence in his turn, before signing it, the clerk felt himself moved with pity for the poor wretch of a prisoner, and, in the hope of obtaining some mitigation of the penalty, he approached as near the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" property="schema:name">auditor</span>'s ear as possible, and said, pointing to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, "That man is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>."</p>
<p>He hoped that this community of infirmity would awaken Master Florian's interest in behalf of the condemned man. But, in the first place, we have already observed that Master Florian did not care to have his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deafness</span> noticed. In the next place, he was so hard of hearing That he did not catch a single word of what the clerk said to him; nevertheless, he wished to have the appearance of hearing, and replied, "Ah! ah! that is different; I did not know that. An hour more of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>, in that case."</p>
<p>And he signed the sentence thus modified.</p>
<p>"'Tis well done," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_(comics)" property="schema:name">Robin</span> Poussepain, who cherished a grudge against <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. "That will teach him to handle people roughly."</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00036">CHAPTER II. THE RAT-HOLE.</h2>
<p>The reader must permit us to take him back to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Place_de_l'Hôtel-de-Ville" property="schema:name">Place de Grève</span>, which we quitted yesterday with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, in order to follow <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span>.</p>
<p>It is ten o'clock in the morning; everything is indicative of the day after a festival. The pavement is covered with rubbish; ribbons, rags, feathers from tufts of plumes, drops of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wax" property="schema:name">wax</span> from the torches, crumbs of the public feast. A goodly number of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> are "sauntering," as we say, here and there, turning over with their feet the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Extinction" property="schema:name">extinct</span> brands of the bonfire, going into raptures in front of the Pillar House, over the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span> of the fine hangings of the day before, and to-day staring at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nail_(fastener)" property="schema:name">nails</span> that secured them a last pleasure. The venders of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cider" property="schema:name">cider</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beer" property="schema:name">beer</span> are rolling their barrels among the groups. Some busy passers-by come and go. The merchants converse and call to each other from the thresholds of their shops. The festival, the ambassadors, Coppenole, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span> of the Fools, are in all mouths; they vie with each other, each trying to criticise it best and laugh the most. And, meanwhile, four mounted sergeants, who have just posted themselves at the four sides of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>, have already concentrated around themselves a goodly proportion of the populace scattered on the Place, who condemn themselves to immobility and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fatigue_(medical)" property="schema:name">fatigue</span> in the hope of a small execution.</p>
<p>If the reader, after having contemplated this lively and noisy scene which is being enacted in all parts of the Place, will now transfer his gaze towards that ancient demi-Gothic, demi-Romanesque house of the Tour-Roland, which forms the corner on the quay to the west, he will observe, at the angle of the façade, a large public <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breviary" property="schema:name">breviary</span>, with rich illuminations, protected from the rain by a little penthouse, and from thieves by a small grating, which, however, permits of the leaves being turned. Beside this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breviary" property="schema:name">breviary</span> is a narrow, arched window, closed by two <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wrought_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> bars in the form of a cross, and looking on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sultan_Qaboos_University" typeof="schema:EducationalOrganization" property="schema:name">squ</span>are; the only opening which admits a small quantity of light and air to a little cell without a door, constructed on the ground-floor, in the thickness of the walls of the old house, and filled with a peace all the more profound, with a silence all the more gloomy, because a public place, the most populous and most noisy in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> swarms and shrieks around it.</p>
<p>This little cell had been celebrated in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> for nearly three centuries, ever since Madame Rolande de la Tour-Roland, in mourning for her father who died in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crusades" property="schema:name">Crusades</span>, had caused it to be hollowed out in the wall of her own house, in order to immure herself there forever, keeping of all her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace" property="schema:name">palace</span> only this lodging whose door was walled up, and whose window stood open, winter and summer, giving all the rest to the poor and to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>. The afflicted damsel had, in fact, waited twenty years for death in this premature tomb, praying night and day for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> of her father, sleeping in ashes, without even a stone for a pillow, clothed in a black sack, and subsisting on the bread and water which the compassion of the passers-by led them to deposit on the ledge of her window, thus receiving charity after having bestowed it. At her death, at the moment when she was passing to the other sepulchre, she had bequeathed this one in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perpetuity" property="schema:name">perpetuity</span> to afflicted women, mothers, widows, or maidens, who should wish to pray much for others or for themselves, and who should desire to inter themselves alive in a great grief or a great <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Penance" property="schema:name">penance</span>. The poor of her day had made her a fine funeral, with tears and benedictions; but, to their great regret, the pious maid had not been <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint" property="schema:name">canonized</span>, for lack of influence. Those among them who were a little inclined to impiety, had hoped that the matter might be accomplished in Paradise more easily than at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Rome</span>, and had frankly besought <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>, instead of the pope, in behalf of the deceased. The majority had contented themselves with holding the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span> of Rolande sacred, and converting her rags into <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Relic" property="schema:name">relics</span>. The city, on its side, had founded in honor of the damoiselle, a public <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breviary" property="schema:name">breviary</span>, which had been fastened near the window of the cell, in order that passers-by might halt there from time to time, were it only to pray; that prayer might remind them of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alms" property="schema:name">alms</span>, and that the poor recluses, heiresses of Madame Rolande's vault, might not die outright of hunger and forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Moreover, this sort of tomb was not so very rare a thing in the cities of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span>. One often encountered in the most frequented street, in the most crowded and noisy market, in the very middle, under the feet of the horses, under the wheels of the carts, as it were, a cellar, a well, a tiny walled and grated cabin, at the bottom of which a human being prayed night and day, voluntarily devoted to some eternal lamentation, to some great expiation. And all the reflections which that strange spectacle would awaken in us to-day; that horrible cell, a sort of intermediary link between a house and the tomb, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cemetery" property="schema:name">cemetery</span> and the city; that living being cut off from the human community, and thenceforth reckoned among the dead; that lamp consuming its last drop of oil in the darkness; that remnant of life flickering in the grave; that breath, that voice, that eternal prayer in a box of stone; that face forever turned towards the other world; that eye already illuminated with another sun; that ear pressed to the walls of a tomb; that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> a prisoner in that body; that body a prisoner in that dungeon cell, and beneath that double envelope of flesh and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Granite" property="schema:name">granite</span>, the murmur of that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> in pain;—nothing of all this was perceived by the crowd. The piety of that age, not very subtle nor much given to reasoning, did not see so many facets in an act of religion. It took the thing in the block, honored, venerated, hallowed the sacrifice at need, but did not analyze the sufferings, and felt but moderate pity for them. It brought some pittance to the miserable penitent from time to time, looked through the hole to see whether he were still living, forgot his name, hardly knew how many years ago he had begun to die, and to the stranger, who questioned them about the living skeleton who was perishing in that cellar, the neighbors replied simply, "It is the recluse."</p>
<p>Everything was then viewed without <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metaphysics" property="schema:name">metaphysics</span>, without exaggeration, without magnifying glass, with the naked eye. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Microscope" property="schema:name">microscope</span> had not yet been invented, either for things of matter or for things of the mind.</p>
<p>Moreover, although people were but little surprised by it, the examples of this sort of cloistration in the hearts of cities were in truth frequent, as we have just said. There were in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> a considerable number of these <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cell_(biology)" property="schema:name">cells</span>, for praying to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> and doing <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Penance" property="schema:name">penance</span>; they were nearly all occupied. It is true that the clergy did not like to have them empty, since that implied lukewarmness in believers, and that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leprosy" property="schema:name">lepers</span> were put into them when there were no penitents on hand. Besides the cell on the Grève, there was one at Montfauçon, one at the Charnier des Innocents, another I hardly know where,—at the Clichon House, I think; others still at many spots where traces of them are found in traditions, in default of memorials. The University had also its own. On Mount <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genevieve" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Sainte-Geneviève</span> a sort of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book_of_Job" property="schema:name">Job</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span>, for the space of thirty years, chanted the seven <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Penitential_Psalms" property="schema:name">penitential psalms</span> on a dunghill at the bottom of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cistern" property="schema:name">cistern</span>, beginning anew when he had finished, singing loudest at night, <i>magna voce per umbras</i>, and to-day, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antiquarian" property="schema:name">antiquary</span> fancies that he hears his voice as he enters the Rue du Puits-qui-parle—the street of the "Speaking Well."</p>
<p>To confine ourselves to the cell in the Tour-Roland, we must say that it had never lacked recluses. After the death of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Madame_Roland" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Madame Roland</span>, it had stood vacant for a year or two, though rarely. Many women had come thither to mourn, until their death, for relatives, lovers, faults. Parisian malice, which thrusts its finger into everything, even into things which concern it the least, affirmed that it had beheld but few widows there.</p>
<p>In accordance with the fashion of the epoch, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span> inscription on the wall indicated to the learned passer-by the pious purpose of this cell. The custom was retained until the middle of the sixteenth century of explaining an edifice by a brief device inscribed above the door. Thus, one still reads in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>, above the wicket of the prison in the seignorial mansion of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anne_Hilarion_de_Tourville" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Tourville</span>, <i>Sileto et spera</i>; in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ireland" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Ireland</span>, beneath the armorial bearings which surmount the grand door to Fortescue Castle, <i>Forte <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scute" property="schema:name">scutum</span>, salus ducum</i>; in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">England</span>, over the principal entrance to the hospitable mansion of the Earls Cowper: <i>Tuum est</i>. At that time every edifice was a thought.</p>
<p>As there was no door to the walled cell of the Tour-Roland, these two words had been carved in large Roman capitals over the window,—</p></body></html>
