<p>"<i>Aut unum bombum</i>."</p>
<p>"Would you like to have her pay you in the face?"</p>
<p>"Comrades! Master Simon Sanguin, the Elector of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Picardy" typeof="schema:AdministrativeArea" property="schema:name">Picardy</span>, with his wife on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crupper" property="schema:name">crupper</span>!"</p>
<p>"<i>Post equitem seclet atra <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eura" property="schema:name">eura</span></i>—behind the horseman sits black care."</p>
<p>"Courage, Master Simon!"</p>
<p>"Good day, Mister Elector!"</p>
<p>"Good night, Madame Electress!"</p>
<p>"How happy they are to see all that!" sighed Joannes de Molendino, still perched in the foliage of his capital.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the sworn bookseller of the university, Master Andry Musnier, was inclining his ear to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fur_clothing" property="schema:name">furrier</span> of the king's robes, Master Gilles Lecornu.</p>
<p>"I tell you, sir, that the end of the world has come. No one has ever beheld such outbreaks among the students! It is the accursed inventions of this century that are ruining everything,—artilleries, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bombard_(weapon)" property="schema:name">bombards</span>, and, above all, printing, that other <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">German</span> pest. No more manuscripts, no more books! printing will kill bookselling. It is the end of the world that is drawing nigh."</p>
<p>"I see that plainly, from the progress of velvet stuffs," said the fur-merchant.</p>
<p>At this moment, midday sounded.</p>
<p>"Ha!" exclaimed the entire crowd, in one voice.</p>
<p>The scholars held their peace. Then a great hurly-burly ensued; a vast movement of feet, hands, and heads; a general outbreak of coughs and handkerchiefs; each one arranged himself, assumed his post, raised himself up, and grouped himself. Then came a great silence; all necks remained outstretched, all mouths remained open, all glances were directed towards the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> table. Nothing made its appearance there. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span>'s four sergeants were still there, stiff, motionless, as painted statues. All eyes turned to the estrade reserved for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemish</span> envoys. The door remained closed, the platform empty. This crowd had been waiting since daybreak for three things: noonday, the embassy from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flanders</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mystery_play" property="schema:name">mystery play</span>. Noonday alone had arrived on time.</p>
<p>On this occasion, it was too much.</p>
<p>They waited one, two, three, five minutes, a quarter of an hour; nothing came. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dais" property="schema:name">dais</span> remained empty, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theatre" property="schema:name">theatre</span> dumb. In the meantime, wrath had succeeded to impatience. Irritated words circulated in a low tone, still, it is true. "The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mystery!" property="schema:name">mystery!</span> the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mystery!" property="schema:name">mystery!</span>" they <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathy_voice" property="schema:name">murmured</span>, in hollow voices. Heads began to ferment. A tempest, which was only rumbling in the distance as yet, was floating on the surface of this crowd. It was Jehan du Moulin who struck the first spark from it.</p>
<p>"The mystery, and to the devil with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemings</span>!" he exclaimed at the full <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span> of his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lung" property="schema:name">lungs</span>, twining like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serpent_(symbolism)" property="schema:name">serpent</span> around his pillar.</p>
<p>The crowd clapped their hands.</p>
<p>"The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mystery!" property="schema:name">mystery!</span>" it repeated, "and may all the devils take <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flanders</span>!"</p>
<p>"We must have the mystery instantly," resumed the student; "or else, my advice is that we should hang the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> of the courts, by way of a morality and a comedy."</p>
<p>"Well said," cried the people, "and let us begin the hanging with his sergeants."</p>
<p>A grand <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acclamation" property="schema:name">acclamation</span> followed. The four poor fellows began to turn pale, and to exchange glances. The crowd hurled itself towards them, and they already beheld the frail wooden railing, which separated them from it, giving way and bending before the pressure of the throng.</p>
<p>It was a critical moment.</p>
<p>"To the sack, to the sack!" rose the cry on all sides.</p>
<p>At that moment, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tapestry" property="schema:name">tapestry</span> of the dressing-room, which we have described above, was raised, and afforded passage to a personage, the mere sight of whom suddenly stopped the crowd, and changed its wrath into curiosity as by enchantment.</p>
<p>"Silence! silence!"</p>
<p>The personage, but little reassured, and trembling in every limb, advanced to the edge of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> table with a vast amount of bows, which, in proportion as he drew nearer, more and more resembled <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genuflection" property="schema:name">genuflections</span>.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, tranquillity had gradually been restored. All that remained was that slight murmur which always rises above the silence of a crowd.</p>
<p>"Messieurs the bourgeois," said he, "and mesdemoiselles the <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span>es</i>, we shall have the honor of declaiming and representing, before his eminence, monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>, a very beautiful morality which has for its title, 'The Good Judgment of Madame the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Virgin Mary</span>.' I am to play <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>. His eminence is, at this moment, escorting the very honorable embassy of the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austria" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Austria</span>; which is detained, at present, listening to the harangue of monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rector_(ecclesiastical)" property="schema:name">rector</span> of the university, at the gate Baudets. As soon as his illustrious eminence, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>, arrives, we will begin."</p>
<p>It is certain, that nothing less than the intervention of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span> was required to save the four unfortunate sergeants of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> of the courts. If we had the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Happiness" property="schema:name">happiness</span> of having invented this very veracious tale, and of being, in consequence, responsible for it before our Lady Criticism, it is not against us that the classic precept, <i>Nec deus intersit</i>, could be invoked. Moreover, the costume of Seigneur <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>, was very handsome, and contributed not a little towards calming the crowd, by attracting all its attention. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span> was clad in a coat of mail, covered with black velvet, with gilt <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nail_(anatomy)" property="schema:name">nails</span>; and had it not been for the rouge, and the huge red beard, each of which covered one-half of his face,—had it not been for the roll of gilded cardboard, spangled, and all bristling with strips of tinsel, which he held in his hand, and in which the eyes of the initiated easily recognized thunderbolts,—had not his feet been flesh-colo<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span>, and banded with ribbons in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_mythology" property="schema:name">Greek</span> fashion, he might have borne comparison, so far as the severity of his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yao_people" property="schema:name">mien</span> was concerned, with a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brittany" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Breton</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archery" property="schema:name">archer</span> from the guard of Monsieur de Berry.</p>
<p><a id="link2HCH0002"><!--  H2 anchor --></a></p>

<br/></div>
<h2 id="pgepubid00008">CHAPTER II. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">PIERRE GRINGOIRE</span>.</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, as be harangued them, the satisfaction and admiration unanimously excited by his costume were dissipated by his words; and when he reached that untoward conclusion: "As soon as his illustrious eminence, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>, arrives, we will begin," his voice was drowned in a thunder of hooting.</p>
<p>"Begin instantly! The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mystery!" property="schema:name">mystery!</span> the mystery immediately!" shrieked the people. And above all the voices, that of Johannes de Molendino was audible, piercing the uproar like the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fife" property="schema:name">fife</span>'s derisive serenade: "Commence instantly!" yelped the scholar.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/County_Down" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Down</span> with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">Cardinal</span> de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Bourbon" property="schema:name">Bourbon</span>!" vociferated <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Hood" property="schema:name">Robin</span> Poussepain and the other clerks perched in the window.</p>
<p>"The morality this very instant!" repeated the crowd; "this very instant! the sack and the rope for the comedians, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>!"</p>
<p>Poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>, haggard, frightened, pale beneath his rouge, dropped his thunderbolt, took his cap in his hand; then he bowed and trembled and stammered: "His eminence—the ambassadors—Madame Marguerite of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flanders</span>—." He did not know what to say. In truth, he was afraid of being hung.</p>
<p>Hung by the populace for waiting, hung by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span> for not having waited, he saw between the two dilemmas only an abyss; that is to say, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallows" property="schema:name">gallows</span>.</p>
<p>Luckily, some one came to rescue him from his embarrassment, and assume the responsibility.</p>
<p>An individual who was standing beyond the railing, in the free space around the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> table, and whom no one had yet caught sight of, since his long, thin body was completely sheltered from every visual ray by the diameter of the pillar against which he was leaning; this individual, we say, tall, gaunt, pallid, blond, still young, although already wrinkled about the brow and cheeks, with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strategic_Defense_Initiative" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">brilliant eyes</span> and a smiling mouth, clad in garments of black <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serge" property="schema:name">serge</span>, worn and shining with age, approached the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> table, and made a sign to the poor sufferer. But the other was so confused that he did not see him. The new comer advanced another step.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>," said he, "my dear <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>!"</p>
<p>The other did not hear.</p>
<p>At last, the tall blond, driven out of patience, shrieked almost in his face,—</p>
<p>"Michel Giborne!"</p>
<p>"Who calls me?" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>, as though awakened with a start.</p>
<p>"I," replied the person clad in black.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>.</p>
<p>"Begin at once," went on the other. "Satisfy the populace; I undertake to appease the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span>, who will appease monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span> breathed once more.</p>
<p>"Messeigneurs the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span>," he cried, at the top of his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lung" property="schema:name">lungs</span> to the crowd, which continued to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoot_(film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">hoot</span> him, "we are going to begin at once."</p>
<p>"<i>Evoe <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>! Plaudite cives</i>! All <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hail" property="schema:name">hail</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>! Applaud, citizens!" shouted the scholars.</p>
<p>"Noel! Noel! good, good," shouted the people.</p>
<p>The hand clapping was deafening, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span> had already withdrawn under his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tapestry" property="schema:name">tapestry</span>, while the hall still trembled with acclamations.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the personage who had so magically turned the tempest into dead calm, as our old and dear <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Corneille" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Corneille</span> puts it, had modestly retreated to the half-shadow of his pillar, and would, no doubt, have remained invisible there, motionless, and mute as before, had he not been plucked by the sleeve by two young women, who, standing in the front row of the spectators, had noticed his colloquy with Michel Giborne-Jupiter.</p>
<p>"Master," said one of them, making him a sign to approach. "Hold your tongue, my dear Liénarde," said her neighbor, pretty, fresh, and very brave, in consequence of being dressed up in her best attire. "He is not a clerk, he is a layman; you must not say master to him, but messire."</p>
<p>"Messire," said Liénarde.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Stranger_(newspaper)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">The stranger</span> approached the railing.</p>
<p>"What would you have of me, damsels?" he asked, with alacrity.</p>
<p>"Oh! nothing," replied Liénarde, in great confusion; "it is my neighbor, Gisquette la Gencienne, who wishes to speak with you."</p>
<p>"Not so," replied Gisquette, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blushing" property="schema:name">blushing</span>; "it was Liénarde who called you master; I only told her to say messire."</p>
<p>The two young girls dropped their eyes. The man, who asked nothing better than to enter into conversation, looked at them with a smile.</p>
<p>"So you have nothing to say to me, damsels?"</p>
<p>"Oh! nothing at all," replied Gisquette.</p>
<p>"Nothing," said Liénarde.</p>
<p>The tall, light-haired young man retreated a step; but the two curious maidens had no mind to let slip their prize.</p>
<p>"Messire," said Gisquette, with the impetuosity of an open <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sluice" property="schema:name">sluice</span>, or of a woman who has made up her mind, "do you know that soldier who is to play the part of Madame the Virgin in the mystery?"</p>
<p>"You mean the part of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>?" replied the stranger.</p>
<p>"Hé! yes," said Liénarde, "isn't she stupid? So you know <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>?"</p>
<p>"Michel Giborne?" replied the unknown; "yes, madam."</p>
<p>"He has a fine beard!" said Liénarde.</p>
<p>"Will what they are about to say here be fine?" inquired Gisquette, timidly.</p>
<p>"Very fine, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miss" property="schema:name">mademoiselle</span>," replied the unknown, without the slightest hesitation.</p>
<p>"What is it to be?" said Liénarde.</p>
<p>"'The Good Judgment of Madame the Virgin,'—a morality, if you please, damsel."</p>
<p>"Ah! that makes a difference," responded Liénarde.</p>
<p>A brief silence ensued—broken by the stranger.</p>
<p>"It is a perfectly new morality, and one which has never yet been played."</p>
<p>"Then it is not the same one," said Gisquette, "that was given two years ago, on the day of the entrance of monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Papal_legate" property="schema:name">legate</span>, and where three handsome maids played the parts—"</p>
<p>"Of sirens," said Liénarde.</p>
<p>"And all naked," added the young man.</p>
<p>Liénarde lowered her eyes modestly. Gisquette glanced at her and did the same. He continued, with a smile,—</p>
<p>"It was a very pleasant thing to see. To-day it is a morality made expressly for Madame the Demoiselle of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flanders</span>."</p>
<p>"Will they sing <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shepherd" property="schema:name">shepherd</span> songs?" inquired Gisquette.</p>
<p>"Fie!" said the stranger, "in a morality? you must not confound styles. If it were a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Farce" property="schema:name">farce</span>, well and good."</p>
<p>"That is a pity," resumed Gisquette. "That day, at the Ponceau Fountain, there were <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wild_man" property="schema:name">wild men</span> and women, who fought and assumed many aspects, as they sang little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Motet" property="schema:name">motets</span> and bergerettes."</p>
<p>"That which is suitable for a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Papal_legate" property="schema:name">legate</span>," returned the stranger, with a good deal of dryness, "is not suitable for a princess."</p>
<p>"And beside them," resumed Liénarde, "played many <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brass_instrument" property="schema:name">brass instruments</span>, making great melodies."</p>
<p>"And for the refreshment of the passers-by," continued Gisquette, "the fountain spouted through three mouths, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milk" property="schema:name">milk</span>, and hippocrass, of which every one drank who wished."</p>
<p>"And a little below the Ponceau, at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trinity" property="schema:name">Trinity</span>," pursued Liénarde, "there was a passion performed, and without any speaking."</p>
<p>"How well I remember that!" exclaimed Gisquette; "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> on the cross, and the two thieves on the right and the left." Here the young gossips, growing warm at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span> of the entrance of monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Papal_legate" property="schema:name">legate</span>, both began to talk at once.</p>
<p>"And, further on, at the Painters' Gate, there were other personages, very richly clad."</p>
<p>"And at the fountain of Saint-Innocent, that huntsman, who was chasing a hind with great clamor of dogs and hunting-horns."</p>
<p>"And, at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> slaughter-houses, stages, representing the fortress of Dieppe!"</p>
<p>"And when the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Papal_legate" property="schema:name">legate</span> passed, you remember, Gisquette? they made the assault, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">English</span> all had their throats cut."</p>
<p>"And against the gate of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Châtelet</span>, there were very fine personages!"</p>
<p>"And on the Port au Change, which was all draped above!"</p>
<p>"And when the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Papal_legate" property="schema:name">legate</span> passed, they let fly on the bridge more than two hundred sorts of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">birds</span>; wasn't it beautiful, Liénarde?"</p>
<p>"It will be better to-day," finally resumed their interlocutor, who seemed to listen to them with impatience.</p>
<p>"Do you promise us that this mystery will be fine?" said Gisquette.</p>
<p>"Without doubt," he replied; then he added, with a certain emphasis,—"I am the author of it, damsels."</p>
<p>"Truly?" said the young girls, quite taken aback.</p>
<p>"Truly!" replied the poet, bridling a little; "that is, to say, there are two of us; Jehan Marchand, who has sawed the planks and erected the framework of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theatre" property="schema:name">theatre</span> and the woodwork; and I, who have made the piece. My name is Pierre <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>."</p>
<p>The author of the "Cid" could not have said "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Corneille" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Pierre Corneille</span>" with more pride.</p>
<p>Our readers have been able to observe, that a certain amount of time must have already elapsed from the moment when <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span> had retired beneath the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tapestry" property="schema:name">tapestry</span> to the instant when the author of the new morality had thus abruptly revealed himself to the innocent admiration of Gisquette and Liénarde. Remarkable fact: that whole crowd, so tumultuous but a few moments before, now waited amiably on the word of the comedian; which proves the eternal truth, still experienced every day in our theatres, that the best means of making the public wait patiently is to assure them that one is about to begin instantly.</p>
<p>However, scholar Johannes had not fallen asleep.</p>
<p>"Holà hé!" he shouted suddenly, in the midst of the peaceable waiting which had followed the tumult. "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>, Madame the Virgin, buffoons of the devil! are you jeering at us? The piece! the piece! commence or we will commence again!"</p>
<p>This was all that was needed.</p>
<p>The music of high and low instruments immediately became audible from the interior of the stage; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tapestry" property="schema:name">tapestry</span> was raised; four personages, in motley attire and painted faces, emerged from it, climbed the steep ladder of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theatre" property="schema:name">theatre</span>, and, arrived upon the upper platform, arranged themselves in a line before the public, whom they saluted with profound reverences; then the symphony ceased.</p>
<p>The mystery was about to begin.</p>
<p>The four personages, after having reaped a rich reward of applause for their reverences, began, in the midst of profound silence, a prologue, which we gladly spare the reader. Moreover, as happens in our own day, the public was more occupied with the costumes that the actors wore than with the roles that they were enacting; and, in truth, they were right. All four were dressed in parti-colored robes of yellow and white, which were distinguished from each other only by the nature of the stuff; the first was of gold and silver <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brocade" property="schema:name">brocade</span>; the second, of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silk" property="schema:name">silk</span>; the third, of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wool" property="schema:name">wool</span>; the fourth, of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linen" property="schema:name">linen</span>. The first of these personages carried in his right hand a sword; the second, two golden keys; the third, a pair of scales; the fourth, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suit_(cards)" property="schema:name">spade</span>: and, in order to aid sluggish minds which would not have seen clearly through the transparency of these attributes, there was to be read, in large, black letters, on the hem of the robe of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brocade" property="schema:name">brocade</span>, MY NAME IS NOBILITY; on the hem of the silken robe, MY NAME IS CLERGY; on the hem of the woolen robe, MY NAME IS MERCHANDISE; on the hem of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linen" property="schema:name">linen</span> robe, MY NAME IS LABOR. The sex of the two male characters was briefly indicated to every judicious spectator, by their shorter robes, and by the cap which they wore on their heads; while the two female characters, less briefly clad, were covered with hoods.</p>
<p>Much ill-will would also have been required, not to comprehend, through the medium of the poetry of the prologue, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Employment" property="schema:name">Labor</span> was wedded to Merchandise, and Clergy to Nobility, and that the two happy couples possessed in common a magnificent golden <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dolphin" property="schema:name">dolphin</span>, which they desired to adjudge to the fairest only. So they were roaming about the world seeking and searching for this beauty, and, after having successively rejected the Queen of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Golkonda" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Golconda</span>, the Princess of Trebizonde, the daughter of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Khagan" property="schema:name">Grand Khan</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tatars" property="schema:name">Tartary</span>, etc., <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Employment" property="schema:name">Labor</span> and Clergy, Nobility and Merchandise, had come to rest upon the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> table of the Palais de Justice, and to utter, in the presence of the honest audience, as many sentences and maxims as could then be dispensed at the Faculty of Arts, at examinations, sophisms, determinances, figures, and acts, where the masters took their degrees.</p>
<p>All this was, in fact, very fine.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in that throng, upon which the four allegories vied with each other in pouring out floods of metaphors, there was no ear more attentive, no heart that palpitated more, not an eye was more haggard, no neck more outstretched, than the eye, the ear, the neck, and the heart of the author, of the poet, of that brave <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span>, who had not been able to resist, a moment before, the joy of telling his name to two pretty girls. He had retreated a few paces from them, behind his pillar, and there he listened, looked, enjoyed. The amiable applause which had greeted the beginning of his prologue was still echoing in his bosom, and he was completely absorbed in that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Species" property="schema:name">species</span> of ecstatic contemplation with which an author beholds his ideas fall, one by one, from the mouth of the actor into the vast silence of the audience. Worthy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span>!</p>
<p>It pains us to say it, but this first <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religious_ecstasy" property="schema:name">ecstasy</span> was speedily disturbed. Hardly had <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> raised this intoxicating cup of joy and triumph to his lips, when a drop of bitterness was mingled with it.</p>
<p>A tattered <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mendicant" property="schema:name">mendicant</span>, who could not collect any coins, lost as he was in the midst of the crowd, and who had not probably found sufficient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indemnity" property="schema:name">indemnity</span> in the pockets of his neighbors, had hit upon the idea of perching himself upon some conspicuous point, in order to attract looks and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alms" property="schema:name">alms</span>. He had, accordingly, hoisted himself, during the first verses of the prologue, with the aid of the pillars of the reserve gallery, to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cornice" property="schema:name">cornice</span> which ran round the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span> at its lower edge; and there he had seated himself, soliciting the attention and the pity of the multitude, with his rags and a hideous sore which covered his right arm. However, he uttered not a word.</p>
<p>The silence which he preserved allowed the prologue to proceed without hindrance, and no perceptible disorder would have ensued, if ill-luck had not willed that the scholar Joannes should catch sight, from the heights of his pillar, of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mendicant" property="schema:name">mendicant</span> and his grimaces. A wild fit of laughter took possession of the young scamp, who, without caring that he was interrupting the spectacle, and disturbing the universal composure, shouted boldly,—</p>
<p>"Look! see that sickly creature asking <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alms" property="schema:name">alms</span>!"</p>
<p>Any one who has thrown a stone into a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frog" property="schema:name">frog</span> pond, or fired a shot into a covey of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">birds</span>, can form an idea of the effect produced by these incongruous words, in the midst of the general attention. It made <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> shudder as though it had been an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electrocution" property="schema:name">electric shock</span>. The prologue stopped short, and all heads turned tumultuously towards the beggar, who, far from being disconcerted by this, saw, in this incident, a good opportunity for reaping his harvest, and who began to whine in a doleful way, half closing his eyes the while,—"Charity, please!"</p>
<p>"Well—upon my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>," resumed Joannes, "it's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span>! Holà he, my friend, did your sore bother you on the leg, that you have transferred it to your arm?" So saying, with the dexterity of a monkey, he flung a bit of silver into the gray felt hat which the beggar held in his ailing arm. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mendicant" property="schema:name">mendicant</span> received both the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alms" property="schema:name">alms</span> and the sarcasm without wincing, and continued, in lamentable tones,—</p>
<p>"Charity, please!"</p>
<p>This episode considerably distracted the attention of the audience; and a goodly number of spectators, among them Robin Poussepain, and all the clerks at their head, gayly applauded this eccentric duet, which the scholar, with his shrill voice, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mendicant" property="schema:name">mendicant</span> had just improvised in the middle of the prologue.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> was highly displeased. On recovering from his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fir" property="schema:name">fir</span>st stupefaction, he bestirred himself to shout, to the four personages on the stage, "Go on! What the devil!—go on!"—without even deigning to cast a glance of disdain upon the two interrupters.</p>
<p>At that moment, he felt some one pluck at the hem of his surtout; he turned round, and not without ill-humor, and found considerable difficulty in smiling; but he was obliged to do so, nevertheless. It was the pretty arm of Gisquette la Gencienne, which, passed through the railing, was soliciting his attention in this manner.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," said the young girl, "are they going to continue?"</p>
<p>"Of course," replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, a good deal shocked by the question.</p>
<p>"In that case, messire," she resumed, "would you have the courtesy to explain to me—"</p>
<p>"What they are about to say?" interrupted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>. "Well, listen."</p>
<p>"No," said Gisquette, "but what they have said so far."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> started, like a man whose wound has been probed to the quick.</p>
<p>"A plague on the stupid and dull-witted little girl!" he muttered, between his teeth.</p>
<p>From that moment forth, Gisquette was nothing to him.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the actors had obeyed his injunction, and the public, seeing that they were beginning to speak again, began once more to listen, not without having lost many beauties in the sort of soldered joint which was formed between the two portions of the piece thus abruptly cut short. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> commented on it bitterly to himself. Nevertheless, tranquillity was gradually restored, the scholar held his peace, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mendicant" property="schema:name">mendicant</span> counted over some coins in his hat, and the piece resumed the upper hand.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, a very fine work, and one which, as it seems to us, might be put to use to-day, by the aid of a little rearrangement. The exposition, rather long and rather empty, that is to say, according to the rules, was simple; and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, in the candid sanctuary of his own conscience, admired its clearness. As the reader may surmise, the four <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allegory" property="schema:name">allegorical</span> personages were somewhat weary with having traversed the three sections of the world, without having found suitable opportunity for getting rid of their golden <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dolphin" property="schema:name">dolphin</span>. Thereupon a eulogy of the marvellous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fish" property="schema:name">fish</span>, with a thousand delicate allusions to the young betrothed of Marguerite of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flanders</span>, then sadly cloistered in at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amboise" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Amboise</span>, and without a suspicion that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Australian_Labor_Party" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">Labor</span> and Clergy, Nobility and Merchandise had just made the circuit of the world in his behalf. The said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dauphin_of_France" property="schema:name">dauphin</span> was then young, was handsome, was stout, and, above all (magnificent origin of all royal virtues), he was the son of the Lion of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>. I declare that this bold metaphor is admirable, and that the natural history of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theatre" property="schema:name">theatre</span>, on a day of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allegory" property="schema:name">allegory</span> and royal marriage songs, is not in the least startled by a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dolphin" property="schema:name">dolphin</span> who is the son of a lion. It is precisely these rare and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pindar" property="schema:name">Pindaric</span> mixtures which prove the poet's enthusiasm. Nevertheless, in order to play the part of critic also, the poet might have developed this beautiful idea in something less than two hundred lines. It is true that the mystery was to last from noon until four o'clock, in accordance with the orders of monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(religion)" property="schema:name">provost</span>, and that it was necessary to say something. Besides, the people listened patiently.</p>
<p>All at once, in the very middle of a quarrel between Mademoiselle Merchandise and Madame Nobility, at the moment when Monsieur <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Australian_Labor_Party" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">Labor</span> was giving utterance to this wonderful line,—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">    In forest ne'er was seen a more triumphant beast;<br/></div>
<p>the door of the reserved gallery which had hitherto remained so inopportunely closed, opened still more inopportunely; and the ringing voice of the usher announced abruptly, "His eminence, Monseigneur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">Cardinal</span> de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Bourbon" property="schema:name">Bourbon</span>."</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00009">CHAPTER III. MONSIEUR THE CARDINAL.</h2>
<p>Poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>! the din of all the great double <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fireworks" property="schema:name">petards</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Jean</span>, the discharge of twenty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arquebus" property="schema:name">arquebuses</span> on supports, the detonation of that famous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gunpowder" property="schema:name">serpentine</span> of the Tower of Billy, which, during the siege of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, on Sunday, the twenty-sixth of September, 1465, killed seven <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Burgundy" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Burgundians</span> at one blow, the explosion of all the powder stored at the gate of the Temple, would have rent his ears less rudely at that solemn and dramatic moment, than these few words, which fell from the lips of the usher, "His eminence, Monseigneur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">Cardinal</span> de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Bourbon" property="schema:name">Bourbon</span>."</p>
<p>It is not that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span> either feared or disdained monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>. He had neither the weakness nor the audacity for that. A true eclectic, as it would be expressed nowadays, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> was one of those firm and lofty, moderate and calm <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">spirits</span>, which always know how to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bear" property="schema:name">bear</span> themselves amid all circumstances (<i>stare in dimidio rerum</i>), and who are full of reason and of liberal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosophy</span>, while still setting store by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinals</span>. A rare, precious, and never interrupted race of philosophers to whom wisdom, like another <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ariadne" property="schema:name">Ariadne</span>, seems to have given a clew of thread which they have been walking along unwinding since the beginning of the world, through the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labyrinth" property="schema:name">labyrinth</span> of human affairs. One finds them in all ages, ever the same; that is to say, always according to all times. And, without reckoning our Pierre <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, who may represent them in the fifteenth century if we succeed in bestowing upon him the distinction which he deserves, it certainly was their spirit which animated Father du Breul, when he wrote, in the sixteenth, these naively sublime words, worthy of all centuries: "I am a Parisian by nation, and a Parrhisian in language, for <i>parrhisia</i> in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece" property="schema:name">Greek</span> signifies liberty of speech; of which I have made use even towards messeigneurs the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinals</span>, uncle and brother to Monsieur the Prince de Conty, always with respect to their greatness, and without offending any one of their suite, which is much to say."</p>
<p>There was then neither hatred for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>, nor disdain for his presence, in the disagreeable impression produced upon <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span>. Quite the contrary; our poet had too much good sense and too threadbare a coat, not to attach particular importance to having the numerous allusions in his prologue, and, in particular, the glorification of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dauphin_of_France" property="schema:name">dauphin</span>, son of the Lion of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>, fall upon the most eminent ear. But it is not interest which predominates in the noble nature of poets. I suppose that the entity of the poet may be represented by the number ten; it is certain that a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemistry" property="schema:name">chemist</span> on analyzing and pharmacopolizing it, as <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/François_Rabelais" property="schema:name">Rabelais</span> says, would find it composed of one part interest to nine parts of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Self-esteem" property="schema:name">self-esteem</span>.</p>
<p>Now, at the moment when the door had opened to admit the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>, the nine parts of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Self-esteem" property="schema:name">self-esteem</span> in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, swollen and expanded by the breath of popular admiration, were in a state of prodigious augmentation, beneath which disappeared, as though stifled, that imperceptible molecule of which we have just remarked upon in the constitution of poets; a precious ingredient, by the way, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Track_ballast" property="schema:name">ballast</span> of reality and humanity, without which they would not touch the earth. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> enjoyed seeing, feeling, fingering, so to speak an entire assembly (of knaves, it is true, but what matters that?) <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stupefied" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">stupefied</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petrifaction" property="schema:name">petrified</span>, and as though <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asphyxia" property="schema:name">asphyxiated</span> in the presence of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dimensional_analysis" property="schema:name">incommensurable</span> tirades which welled up every instant from all parts of his bridal song. I affirm that he shared the general beatitude, and that, quite the reverse of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_de_La_Fontaine" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">La Fontaine</span>, who, at the presentation of his comedy of the "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florence" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Florentine</span>," asked, "Who is the ill-bred lout who made that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epic_poetry" property="schema:name">rhapsody</span>?" <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> would gladly have inquired of his neighbor, "Whose masterpiece is this?"</p>
<p>The reader can now judge of the effect produced upon him by the abrupt and unseasonable arrival of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>.</p>
<p>That which he had to fear was only too fully realized. The entrance of his eminence upset the audience. All heads turned towards the gallery. It was no longer possible to hear one's self. "The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>! The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>!" repeated all mouths. The unhappy prologue stopped short for the second time.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span> halted for a moment on the threshold of the estrade. While he was sending a rather indifferent glance around the audience, the tumult redoubled. Each person wished to get a better view of him. Each man vied with the other in thrusting his head over his neighbor's shoulder.</p>
<p>He was, in fact, an exalted personage, the sight of whom was well worth any other comedy. Charles, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">Cardinal</span> de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Bourbon" property="schema:name">Bourbon</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archbishop_of_Canterbury" property="schema:name">Archbishop</span> and Comte of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lyon" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Lyon</span>, Primate of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaul" property="schema:name">Gauls</span>, was allied both to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>., through his brother, Pierre, Seigneur de Beaujeu, who had married the king's eldest daughter, and to Charles the Bold through his mother, Agnes of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Burgundy" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Burgundy</span>. Now, the dominating trait, the peculiar and distinctive trait of the character of the Primate of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaul" property="schema:name">Gauls</span>, was the spirit of the courtier, and devotion to the powers that be. The reader can form an idea of the numberless embarrassments which this double relationship had caused him, and of all the temporal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reef" property="schema:name">reefs</span> among which his spiritual <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barque" property="schema:name">bark</span> had been forced to tack, in order not to suffer shipwreck on either Louis or Charles, that Scylla and that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_minor_DC_Comics_characters" property="schema:name">Charybdis</span> which had devoured the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duke_of_Nemours" property="schema:name">Duc de Nemours</span> and the Constable de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Pol</span>. Thanks to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heaven" property="schema:name">Heaven</span>'s mercy, he had made the voyage successfully, and had reached home without hindrance. But although he was in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Port" property="schema:name">port</span>, and precisely because he was in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Port" property="schema:name">port</span>, he never recalled without disquiet the varied haps of his political career, so long uneasy and laborious. Thus, he was in the habit of saying that the year 1476 had been "white and black" for him—meaning thereby, that in the course of that year he had lost his mother, the Duchesse de la <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duke_of_Bourbon" property="schema:name">Bourbonnais</span>, and his cousin, the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Burgundy" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Burgundy</span>, and that one grief had consoled him for the other.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he was a fine man; he led a joyous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>'s life, liked to enliven himself with the royal vintage of Challuau, did not hate Richarde la Garmoise and Thomasse la Saillarde, bestowed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alms" property="schema:name">alms</span> on pretty girls rather than on old women,—and for all these reasons was very agreeable to the populace of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. He never went about otherwise than surrounded by a small court of bishops and abbés of high lineage, gallant, jovial, and given to carousing on occasion; and more than once the good and devout women of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germain_of_Paris" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint Germain</span> d' <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Diocese_of_Auxerre" property="schema:name">Auxerre</span>, when passing at night beneath the brightly illuminated windows of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Bourbon" property="schema:name">Bourbon</span>, had been scandalized to hear the same voices which had intoned <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vespers" property="schema:name">vespers</span> for them during the day carolling, to the clinking of glasses, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dionysus" property="schema:name">bacchic</span> proverb of Benedict XII., that pope who had added a third <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span> to the Tiara—<i>Bibamus papaliter</i>.</p>
<p>It was this justly acquired popularity, no doubt, which preserved him on his entrance from any bad reception at the hands of the mob, which had been so displeased but a moment before, and very little disposed to respect a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span> on the very day when it was to elect a pope. But the Parisians cherish little rancor; and then, having forced the beginning of the play by their authority, the good <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> had got the upper hand of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>, and this triumph was sufficient for them. Moreover, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">Cardinal</span> de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Bourbon" property="schema:name">Bourbon</span> was a handsome man,—he wore a fine scarlet robe, which he carried off very well,—that is to say, he had all the women on his side, and, consequently, the best half of the audience. Assuredly, it would be injustice and bad taste to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoot_(film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">hoot</span> a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span> for having come late to the spectacle, when he is a handsome man, and when he wears his scarlet robe well.</p>
<p>He entered, then, bowed to those present with the hereditary smile of the great for the people, and directed his course slowly towards his scarlet velvet arm-chair, with the air of thinking of something quite different. His cortege—what we should nowadays call his staff—of bishops and abbés invaded the estrade in his train, not without causing redoubled tumult and curiosity among the audience. Each man vied with his neighbor in pointing them out and naming them, in seeing who should recognize at least one of them: this one, the Bishop of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marseille" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Marseilles</span> (Alaudet, if my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span> serves me right);—this one, the primicier of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Denis" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Denis</span>;—this one, Robert de Lespinasse, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abbot" property="schema:name">Abbé</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Germain-des-Prés" property="schema:name">Saint-Germain des Prés</span>, that libertine brother of a mistress of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>.; all with many errors and absurdities. As for the scholars, they swore. This was their day, their feast of fools, their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saturnalia" property="schema:name">saturnalia</span>, the annual <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orgy" property="schema:name">orgy</span> of the corporation of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law_clerk" property="schema:name">Law clerks</span> and of the school. There was no turpitude which was not sacred on that day. And then there were <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homosexuality" property="schema:name">gay</span> gossips in the crowd—Simone Quatrelivres, Agnes la Gadine, and Rabine Piédebou. Was it not the least that one could do to swear at one's ease and revile the name of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> a little, on so fine a day, in such good company as dignitaries of the church and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loose_Women" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">loose women</span>? So they did not abstain; and, in the midst of the uproar, there was a frightful concert of blasphemies and enormities of all the unbridled tongues, the tongues of clerks and students restrained during the rest of the year, by the fear of the hot <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_IX_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint Louis</span>. Poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_IX_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint Louis</span>! how they set him at defiance in his own court of law! Each one of them selected from the new-comers on the platform, a black, gray, white, or violet <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cassock" property="schema:name">cassock</span> as his target. Joannes Frollo de Molendin, in his quality of brother to an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, boldly attacked the scarlet; he sang in deafening tones, with his impudent eyes fastened on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>, "<i>Cappa repleta mero</i>!"</p>
<p>All these details which we here lay bare for the edification of the reader, were so covered by the general uproar, that they were lost in it before reaching the reserved platforms; moreover, they would have moved the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span> but little, so much a part of the customs were the liberties of that day. Moreover, he had another cause for solicitude, and his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yao_people" property="schema:name">mien</span> as wholly preoccupied with it, which entered the estrade the same time as himself; this was the embassy from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flanders</span>.</p>
<p>Not that he was a profound politician, nor was he borrowing trouble about the possible consequences of the marriage of his cousin Marguerite de Bourgoyne to his cousin Charles, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dauphin_of_France" property="schema:name">Dauphin</span> de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienne" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Vienne</span>; nor as to how long the good understanding which had been patched up between the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austria" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Austria</span> and the King of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span> would last; nor how the King of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">England</span> would take this disdain of his daughter. All that troubled him but little; and he gave a warm reception every evening to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span> of the royal vintage of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/16th_arrondissement_of_Paris" property="schema:name">Chaillot</span>, without a suspicion that several flasks of that same <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span> (somewhat revised and corrected, it is true, by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doctor_(Doctor_Who)" property="schema:name">Doctor</span> Coictier), cordially offered to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_IV_of_England" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Edward IV</span>. by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>., would, some fine morning, rid <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_IV_of_England" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Edward IV</span>. "The much honored embassy of Monsieur the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austria" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Austria</span>," brought the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span> none of these cares, but it troubled him in another direction. It was, in fact, somewhat hard, and we have already hinted at it on the second page of this book,—for him, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_III,_Duke_of_Bourbon" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles de Bourbon</span>, to be obliged to feast and receive cordially no one knows what <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span>;—for him, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>, to receive <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alderman" property="schema:name">aldermen</span>;—for him, a Frenchman, and a jolly companion, to receive <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemish</span> beer-drinkers,—and that in public! This was, certainly, one of the most irksome grimaces that he had ever executed for the good pleasure of the king.</p>
<p>So he turned toward the door, and with the best <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_grace" property="schema:name">grace</span> in the world (so well had he trained himself to it), when the usher announced, in a sonorous voice, "Messieurs the Envoys of Monsieur the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austria" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Austria</span>." It is useless to add that the whole hall did the same.</p>
<p>Then arrived, two by two, with a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gravitation" property="schema:name">gravity</span> which made a contrast in the midst of the frisky ecclesiastical escort of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_III,_Duke_of_Bourbon" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles de Bourbon</span>, the eight and forty ambassadors of Maximilian of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austria" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Austria</span>, having at their head the reverend Father in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>, Jehan, Abbot of Saint-Bertin, Chancellor of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Order_of_the_Golden_Fleece" property="schema:name">Golden Fleece</span>, and Jacques de Goy, Sieur Dauby, Grand <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">Bailiff</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghent" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Ghent</span>. A deep silence settled over the assembly, accompanied by stifled laughter at the preposterous names and all the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> designations which each of these personages transmitted with imperturbable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gravitation" property="schema:name">gravity</span> to the usher, who then tossed names and titles pell-mell and mutilated to the crowd below. There were Master Loys Roelof, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Schepen" property="schema:name">alderman</span> of the city of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_University_of_Leuven" typeof="schema:EducationalOrganization" property="schema:name">Louvain</span>; Messire Clays d'Etuelde, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Schepen" property="schema:name">alderman</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brussels" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Brussels</span>; Messire Paul de Baeust, Sieur de Voirmizelle, President of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flanders</span>; Master Jehan Coleghens, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burgomaster" property="schema:name">burgomaster</span> of the city of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antwerp" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Antwerp</span>; Master George de la Moere, first <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Schepen" property="schema:name">alderman</span> of the kuere of the city of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghent" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Ghent</span>; Master Gheldolf van der Hage, first <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Schepen" property="schema:name">alderman</span> of the <i>parchous</i> of the said town; and the Sieur de Bierbecque, and Jehan Pinnock, and Jehan Dymaerzelle, etc., etc., etc.; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiffs</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Schepen" property="schema:name">aldermen</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burgomaster" property="schema:name">burgomasters</span>; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burgomaster" property="schema:name">burgomasters</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Schepen" property="schema:name">aldermen</span>, bailiffs—all stiff, affectedly grave, formal, dressed out in velvet and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Damask" property="schema:name">damask</span>, hooded with caps of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Velvet_(song)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">black velvet</span>, with great tufts of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyprus" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Cyprus</span> gold thread; good <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemish</span> heads, after all, severe and worthy faces, of the family which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rembrandt" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Rembrandt</span> makes to stand out so strong and grave from the black background of his "Night Patrol "; personages all of whom bore, written on their brows, that Maximilian of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austria" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Austria</span> had done well in "trusting implicitly," as the manifest ran, "in their sense, valor, experience, loyalty, and good wisdom."</p>
<p>There was one exception, however. It was a subtle, intelligent, crafty-looking face, a sort of combined monkey and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diplomacy" property="schema:name">diplomat</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hablot_Knight_Browne" property="schema:name">phiz</span>, before whom the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span> made three steps and a profound bow, and whose name, nevertheless, was only, "Guillaume Rym, counsellor and pensioner of the City of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghent" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Ghent</span>."</p>
<p>Few persons were then aware who Guillaume Rym was. A rare genius who in a time of revolution would have made a brilliant appearance on the surface of events, but who in the fifteenth century was reduced to cavernous intrigues, and to "living in mines," as the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_de_Rouvroy,_duc_de_Saint-Simon" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Duc de Saint-Simon</span> expresses it. Nevertheless, he was appreciated by the "miner" of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Europe</span>; he plotted familiarly with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>., and often lent a hand to the king's secret jobs. All which things were quite unknown to that throng, who were amazed at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>'s politeness to that frail figure of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemish</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span>.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00010">CHAPTER IV. MASTER JACQUES COPPENOLE.</h2>
<p>While the pensioner of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghent" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Ghent</span> and his eminence were exchanging very low bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by the side of a fox. His felt <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doublet_(clothing)" property="schema:name">doublet</span> and leather jerkin made a spot on the velvet and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silk" property="schema:name">silk</span> which surrounded him. Presuming that he was some groom who had stolen in, the usher stopped him.</p>
<p>"Hold, my friend, you cannot pass!"</p>
<p>The man in the leather jerkin shouldered him aside.</p>
<p>"What does this knave want with me?" said he, in stentorian tones, which rendered the entire hall attentive to this strange colloquy. "Don't you see that I am one of them?"</p>
<p>"Your name?" demanded the usher.</p>
<p>"Jacques Coppenole."</p>
<p>"Your titles?"</p>
<p>"Hosier at the sign of the 'Three Little Chains,' of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghent" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Ghent</span>."</p>
<p>The usher recoiled. One might bring one's self to announce <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alderman" property="schema:name">aldermen</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burgomaster" property="schema:name">burgomasters</span>, but a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span> was too much. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span> was on thorns. All the people were staring and listening. For two days his eminence had been exerting his utmost efforts to lick these <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemish</span> bears into shape, and to render them a little more presentable to the public, and this freak was startling. But Guillaume Rym, with his polished smile, approached the usher.</p>
<p>"Announce Master Jacques Coppenole, clerk of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alderman" property="schema:name">aldermen</span> of the city of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghent" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Ghent</span>," he whispered, very low.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Usher_(entertainer)" property="schema:name">Usher</span>," interposed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>, aloud, "announce Master Jacques Coppenole, clerk of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alderman" property="schema:name">aldermen</span> of the illustrious city of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghent" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Ghent</span>."</p>
<p>This was a mistake. Guillaume Rym alone might have conjured away the difficulty, but Coppenole had heard the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>.</p>
<p>"No, cross of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>?" he exclaimed, in his voice of thunder, "Jacques Coppenole, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span>. Do you hear, usher? Nothing more, nothing less. Cross of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span>; that's fine enough. Monsieur the Archduke has more than once sought his <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gant_U.S.A." property="schema:name">gant</span></i>* in my hose."</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  Got the first idea of a timing.<br/></div>
<p>Laughter and applause burst forth. A jest is always understood in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, and, consequently, always applauded.</p>
<p>Let us add that Coppenole was of the people, and that the auditors which surrounded him were also of the people. Thus the communication between him and them had been prompt, electric, and, so to speak, on a level. The haughty air of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemish</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span>, by humiliating the courtiers, had touched in all these <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plebs" property="schema:name">plebeian</span> souls that latent sentiment of dignity still vague and indistinct in the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>This <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span> was an equal, who had just held his own before monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>. A very sweet reflection to poor fellows habituated to respect and obedience towards the underlings of the sergeants of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Panthéon,_Paris" property="schema:name">Sainte-Geneviève</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>'s train-bearer.</p>
<p>Coppenole proudly saluted his eminence, who returned the salute of the all-powerful <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> feared by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. Then, while Guillaume Rym, a "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">sage</span> and malicious man," as <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philippe_de_Commines" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Philippe de Comines</span> puts it, watched them both with a smile of raillery and superiority, each sought his place, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span> quite abashed and troubled, Coppenole tranquil and haughty, and thinking, no doubt, that his title of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span> was as good as any other, after all, and that Marie of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Burgundy" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Burgundy</span>, mother to that Marguerite whom Coppenole was to-day bestowing in marriage, would have been less afraid of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span> than of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span>; for it is not a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span> who would have stirred up a revolt among the men of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghent" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Ghent</span> against the favorites of the daughter of Charles the Bold; it is not a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span> who could have fortified the populace with a word against her tears and prayers, when the Maid of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/County_of_Flanders" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Flanders</span> came to supplicate her people in their behalf, even at the very foot of the scaffold; while the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span> had only to raise his leather elbow, in order to cause to fall your two heads, most illustrious <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord" property="schema:name">seigneurs</span>, Guy d'Hymbercourt and Chancellor Guillaume Hugonet.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all was over for the poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>, and he was obliged to quaff to the dregs the bitter cup of being in such b.ad company.</p>
<p>The reader has, probably, not forgotten the impudent beggar who had been clinging fast to the fringes of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>'s gallery ever since the beginning of the prologue. The arrival of the illustrious guests had by no means caused him to relax his hold, and, while the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prelate" property="schema:name">prelates</span> and ambassadors were packing themselves into the stalls—like genuine <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/County_of_Flanders" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Flemish</span> herrings—he settled himself at his ease, and boldly crossed his legs on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Architrave" property="schema:name">architrave</span>. The insolence of this proceeding was extraordinary, yet no one noticed it at first, the attention of all being directed elsewhere. He, on his side, perceived nothing that was going on in the hall; he wagged his head with the unconcern of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naples" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Neapolitan</span>, repeating from time to time, amid the clamor, as from a mechanical habit, "Charity, please!" And, assuredly, he was, out of all those present, the only one who had not deigned to turn his head at the altercation between Coppenole and the usher. Now, chance <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bhikkhu" property="schema:name">ordained</span> that the master <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghent" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Ghent</span>, with whom the people were already in lively sympathy, and upon whom all eyes were riveted—should come and seat himself in the front row of the gallery, directly above the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mendicant_orders" property="schema:name">mendicant</span>; and people were not a little amazed to see the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemish</span> ambassador, on concluding his inspection of the knave thus placed beneath his eyes, bestow a friendly tap on that ragged shoulder. The beggar turned round; there was surprise, recognition, a lighting up of the two countenances, and so forth; then, without paying the slightest heed in the world to the spectators, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span> and the wretched being began to converse in a low tone, holding each other's hands, in the meantime, while the rags of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span>, spread out upon the cloth of gold of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dais" property="schema:name">dais</span>, produced the effect of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caterpillar" property="schema:name">caterpillar</span> on an orange.</p>
<p>The novelty of this singular scene excited such a murmur of mirth and gayety in the hall, that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span> was not slow to perceive it; he half bent forward, and, as from the point where he was placed he could catch only an imperfect view of Trouillerfou's ignominious <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doublet_(linguistics)" property="schema:name">doublet</span>, he very naturally imagined that the mendicant was asking <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alms" property="schema:name">alms</span>, and, disgusted with his audacity, he exclaimed: "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">Bailiff</span> of the Courts, toss me that knave into the river!"</p>
<p>"Cross of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monsignor" property="schema:name">monseigneur</span> the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>," said Coppenole, without quitting <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>'s hand, "he's a friend of mine."</p>
<p>"Good! good!" shouted the populace. From that moment, Master Coppenole enjoyed in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> as in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghent" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Ghent</span>, "great favor with the people; for men of that sort do enjoy it," says <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philippe_de_Commines" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Philippe de Comines</span>, "when they are thus disorderly." The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span> bit his lips. He bent towards his neighbor, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abbot" property="schema:name">Abbé</span> of Saint Geneviéve, and said to him in a low tone,—"Fine ambassadors monsieur the archduke sends here, to announce to us Madame Marguerite!"</p>
<p>"Your eminence," replied the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abbot" property="schema:name">abbé</span>, "wastes your politeness on these Flemish swine. <i>Margaritas ante porcos</i>, pearls before swine."</p>
<p>"Say rather," retorted the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>, with a smile, "<i>Porcos ante Margaritam</i>, swine before the pearl."</p>
<p>The whole little court in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cassock" property="schema:name">cassocks</span> went into ecstacies over this play upon words. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span> felt a little relieved; he was quits with Coppenole, he also had had his jest applauded.</p>
<p>Now, will those of our readers who possess the power of generalizing an image or an idea, as the expression runs in the style of to-day, permit us to ask them if they have formed a very clear conception of the spectacle presented at this moment, upon which we <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hectare" property="schema:name">ha</span>ve arrested their attention, by the vast <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parallelogram" property="schema:name">parallelogram</span> of the grand hall of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace_of_Versailles" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">palace</span>.</p>
<p>In the middle of the hall, backed against the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Western_Wall" property="schema:name">western wall</span>, a large and magnificent gallery draped with cloth of gold, into which enter in procession, through a small, arched door, grave personages, announced successively by the shrill voice of an usher. On the front benches were already a number of venerable figures, muffled in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stoat" property="schema:name">ermine</span>, velvet, and scarlet. Around the dais—which remains <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span> and dignified—below, opposite, everywhere, a great crowd and a great murmur. Thousands of glances directed by the people on each face upon the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dais" property="schema:name">dais</span>, a thousand whispers over each name. Certainly, the spectacle is curious, and well deserves the attention of the spectators. But yonder, quite at the end, what is that sort of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trestle" property="schema:name">trestle</span> work with four motley puppets upon it, and more below? Who is that man beside the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trestle" property="schema:name">trestle</span>, with a black <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doublet_(clothing)" property="schema:name">doublet</span> and a pale face? Alas! my dear reader, it is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span> and his prologue.</p>
<p>We have all forgotten him completely.</p>
<p>This is precisely what he feared.</p>
<p>From the moment of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>'s entrance, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> had never ceased to tremble for the safety of his prologue. At first he had enjoined the actors, who had stopped in suspense, to continue, and to raise their voices; then, perceiving that no one was listening, he had stopped them; and, during the entire quarter of an hour that the interruption lasted, he had not ceased to stamp, to flounce about, to appeal to Gisquette and Liénarde, and to urge his neighbors to the continuance of the prologue; all in vain. No one quitted the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>, the embassy, and the gallery—sole centre of this vast circle of visual rays. We must also believe, and we say it with regret, that the prologue had begun slightly to weary the audience at the moment when his eminence had arrived, and created a diversion in so terrible a fashion. After all, on the gallery as well as on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> table, the spectacle was the same: the conflict of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Australian_Labor_Party" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">Labor</span> and Clergy, of Nobility and Merchandise. And many people preferred to see them alive, breathing, moving, elbowing each other in flesh and blood, in this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemish</span> embassy, in this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bishop" property="schema:name">Episcopal</span> court, under the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>'s robe, under Coppenole's jerkin, than painted, decked out, talking in verse, and, so to speak, stuffed beneath the yellow amid white tunics in which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> had so ridiculously clothed them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when our poet beheld quiet reestablished to some extent, he devised a stratagem which might have redeemed all.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," he said, turning towards one of his neighbors, a fine, big man, with a patient face, "suppose we begin again."</p>
<p>"What?" said his neighbor.</p>
<p>"Hé! the Mystery," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p>"As you like," returned his neighbor.</p>
<p>This semi-approbation sufficed for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, and, conducting his own affairs, he began to shout, confounding himself with the crowd as much as possible: "Begin the mystery again! begin again!"</p>
<p>"The devil!" said Joannes de Molendino, "what are they jabbering down yonder, at the end of the hall?" (for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> was making noise enough for four.) "Say, comrades, isn't that mystery finished? They want to begin it all over again. That's not fair!"</p>
<p>"No, no!" shouted all the scholars. "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/County_Down" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Down</span> with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mystery!" property="schema:name">mystery!</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/County_Down" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Down</span> with it!"</p>
<p>But <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> had multiplied himself, and only shouted the more vigorously: "Begin again! begin again!"</p>
<p>These clamors attracted the attention of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>.</p>
<p>"Monsieur <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">Bailiff</span> of the Courts," said he to a tall, black man, placed a few paces from him, "are those knaves in a holy-water vessel, that they make such a hellish noise?"</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> of the courts was a sort of amphibious <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magistrate" property="schema:name">magistrate</span>, a sort of bat of the judicial order, related to both the rat and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">bird</span>, the judge and the soldier.</p>
<p>He approached his eminence, and not without a good deal of fear of the latter's displeasure, he awkwardly explained to him the seeming disrespect of the audience: that noonday had arrived before his eminence, and that the comedians had been forced to begin without waiting for his eminence.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span> burst into a laugh.</p>
<p>"On my faith, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rector_(academia)" property="schema:name">rector</span> of the university ought to have done the same. What say you, Master Guillaume Rym?"</p>
<p>"Monseigneur," replied Guillaume Rym, "let us be content with having escaped half of the comedy. There is at least that much gained."</p>
<p>"Can these rascals continue their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Farce" property="schema:name">farce</span>?" asked the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span>.</p>
<p>"Continue, continue," said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>, "it's all the same to me. I'll read my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breviary" property="schema:name">breviary</span> in the meantime."</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> advanced to the edge of the estrade, and cried, after having invoked silence by a wave of the hand,—</p>
<p>"Bourgeois, rustics, and citizens, in order to satisfy those who wish the play to begin again, and those who wish it to end, his eminence orders that it be continued."</p>
<p>Both parties were forced to resign themselves. But the public and the author long cherished a grudge against the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>.</p>
<p>So the personages on the stage took up their parts, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> hoped that the rest of his work, at least, would be listened to. This hope was speedily dispelled like his other illusions; silence had indeed, been restored in the audience, after a fashion; but <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> had not observed that at the moment when the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span> gave the order to continue, the gallery was far from full, and that after the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemish</span> envoys there had arrived new personages forming part of the cortege, whose names and ranks, shouted out in the midst of his dialogue by the intermittent cry of the usher, produced considerable ravages in it. Let the reader imagine the effect in the midst of a theatrical piece, of the yelping of an usher, flinging in between two rhymes, and often in the middle of a line, parentheses like the following,—</p>
<p>"Master Jacques Charmolue, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Promagistrate" property="schema:name">procurator</span> to the king in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ecclesiastical_court" property="schema:name">Ecclesiastical Courts</span>!"</p>
<p>"Jehan de Harlay, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Equerry" property="schema:name">equerry</span> guardian of the office of chevalier of the night watch of the city of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>!"</p>
<p>"Messire Galiot de Genoilhac, chevalier, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord" property="schema:name">seigneur</span> de Brussac, master of the king's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artillery" property="schema:name">artillery</span>!"</p>
<p>"Master Dreux-Raguier, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surveying" property="schema:name">surveyor</span> of the woods and forests of the king our sovereign, in the land of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Champagne_(historical_province)" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Champagne</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brie" property="schema:name">Brie</span>!"</p>
<p>"Messire Louis de Graville, chevalier, councillor, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chamberlain_(office)" property="schema:name">chamberlain</span> of the king, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Admiral_of_France" property="schema:name">admiral</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>, keeper of the Forest of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vincennes" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Vincennes</span>!"</p>
<p>"Master Denis le Mercier, guardian of the house of the blind at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>!" etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>This was becoming unbearable.</p>
<p>This strange accompaniment, which rendered it difficult to follow the piece, made Gringoire all the more indignant because he could not conceal from himself the fact that the interest was continually increasing, and that all his work required was a chance of being heard.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, difficult to imagine a more ingenious and more dramatic composition. The four personages of the prologue were bewailing themselves in their mortal embarrassment, when <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venus_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Venus</span> in person, (<i>vera incessa patuit dea</i>) presented herself to them, clad in a fine robe bearing the heraldic device of the ship of the city of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. She had come herself to claim the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dolphin" property="schema:name">dolphin</span> promised to the most beautiful. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>, whose thunder could be heard rumbling in the dressing-room, supported her claim, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venus_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Venus</span> was on the point of carrying it off,—that is to say, without <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allegory" property="schema:name">allegory</span>, of marrying monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dauphin_of_France" property="schema:name">dauphin</span>, when a young child clad in white <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Damask" property="schema:name">damask</span>, and holding in her hand a daisy (a transparent personification of Mademoiselle Marguerite of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flanders</span>) came to contest it with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venus_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Venus</span>.</p>
<p>Theatrical effect and change.</p>
<p>After a dispute, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venus_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Venus</span>, Marguerite, and the assistants agreed to submit to the good judgment of time <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">holy Virgin</span>. There was another good part, that of the king of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesopotamia" property="schema:name">Mesopotamia</span>; but through so many interruptions, it was difficult to make out what end he served. All these persons had ascended by the ladder to the stage.</p>
<p>But all was over; none of these beauties had been felt nor understood. On the entrance of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>, one would have said that an invisible <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span> thread had suddenly drawn all glances from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> table to the gallery, from the southern to the western extremity of the hall. Nothing could disenchant the audience; all eyes remained fixed there, and the new-comers and their accursed names, and their faces, and their costumes, afforded a continual diversion. This was very distressing. With the exception of Gisquette and Liénarde, who turned round from time to time when <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> plucked them by the sleeve; with the exception of the big, patient neighbor, no one listened, no one looked at the poor, deserted morality full face. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> saw only profiles.</p>
<p>With what bitterness did he behold his whole erection of glory and of poetry crumble away bit by bit! And to think that these people had been upon the point of instituting a revolt against the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> through impatience to hear his work! now that they had it they did not care for it. This same representation which had been begun amid so unanimous an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acclamation" property="schema:name">acclamation</span>! Eternal flood and ebb of popular favor! To think that they had been on the point of hanging the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span>'s <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sergeant" property="schema:name">sergeant</span>! What would he not have given to be still at that hour of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Honey" property="schema:name">honey</span>!</p>
<p>But the usher's brutal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monologue" property="schema:name">monologue</span> came to an end; every one had arrived, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> breathed freely once more; the actors continued bravely. But Master Coppenole, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span>, must needs rise of a sudden, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> was forced to listen to him deliver, amid universal attention, the following abominable harangue.</p>
<p>"Messieurs the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> and squires of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, I don't know, cross of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>! what we are doing here. I certainly do see yonder in the corner on that stage, some people who appear to be fighting. I don't know whether that is what you call a "mystery," but it is not amusing; they quarrel with their tongues and nothing more. I have been waiting for the first blow this quarter of an hour; nothing comes; they are cowards who only scratch each other with insults. You ought to send for the fighters of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">London</span> or <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rotterdam" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Rotterdam</span>; and, I can tell you! you would have had blows of the fist that could be heard in the Place; but these men excite our pity. They ought at least, to give us a moorish dance, or some other <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mummers_Play" property="schema:name">mummer</span>! That is not what was told me; I was promised a feast of fools, with the election of a pope. We have our pope of fools at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghent" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Ghent</span> also; we're not behindhand in that, cross of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>! But this is the way we manage it; we collect a crowd like this one here, then each person in turn passes his head through a hole, and makes a grimace at the rest; time one who makes the ugliest, is elected pope by general <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acclamation" property="schema:name">acclamation</span>; that's the way it is. It is very diverting. Would you like to make your pope after the fashion of my country? At all events, it will be less wearisome than to listen to chatterers. If they wish to come and make their grimaces through the hole, they can join the game. What say you, Messieurs les bourgeois? You have here enough grotesque specimens of both sexes, to allow of laughing in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemish</span> fashion, and there are enough of us ugly in countenance to hope for a fine grinning match."</p>
<p>Gringoire would have liked to retort; stupefaction, rage, indignation, deprived him of words. Moreover, the suggestion of the popular <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span> was received with such enthusiasm by these <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> who were flattered at being called "squires," that all resistance was useless. There was nothing to be done but to allow one's self to drift with the torrent. Gringoire hid his face between his two hands, not being so fortunate as to have a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantle_(mollusc)" property="schema:name">mantle</span> with which to veil his head, like <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Agamemnon" property="schema:name">Agamemnon</span> of Timantis.</p>
