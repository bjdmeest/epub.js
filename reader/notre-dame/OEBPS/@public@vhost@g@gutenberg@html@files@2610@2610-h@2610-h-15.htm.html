<h2 id="pgepubid00056">CHAPTER VI. THREE HUMAN HEARTS DIFFERENTLY CONSTRUCTED.</h2>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> was not dead, however. Men of that stamp die hard. When Master Philippe Lheulier, advocate extraordinary of the king, had said to poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">Esmeralda</span>; "He is dying," it was an error or a jest. When the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> had repeated to the condemned girl; "He is dead," the fact is that he knew nothing about it, but that he believed it, that he counted on it, that he did not doubt it, that he devoutly hoped it. It would have been too hard for him to give favorable news of his rival to the woman whom he loved. Any man would have done the same in his place.</p>
<p>It was not that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>'s wound had not been serious, but it had not been as much so as the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> believed. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span>, to whom the soldiers of the watch had carried him at the first moment, had feared for his life during the space of a week, and had even told him so in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span>. But youth had gained the upper hand; and, as frequently happens, in spite of prognostications and diagnoses, nature had amused herself by saving the sick man under the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span>'s very nose. It was while he was still lying on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leech" property="schema:name">leech</span>'s pallet that he had submitted to the interrogations of Philippe Lheulier and the official inquisitors, which had annoyed him greatly. Hence, one fine morning, feeling himself better, he had left his golden spurs with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leech" property="schema:name">leech</span> as payment, and had slipped away. This had not, however, interfered with the progress of the affair. Justice, at that epoch, troubled itself very little about the clearness and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Article_(grammar)" property="schema:name">definiteness</span> of a criminal suit. Provided that the accused was hung, that was all that was necessary. Now the judge had plenty of proofs against la <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">Esmeralda</span>. They had supposed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> to be dead, and that was the end of the matter.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, on his side, had not fled far. He had simply rejoined his company in garrison at Queue-en-Brie, in the Isle-de-France, a few stages from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>.</p>
<p>After all, it did not please him in the least to appear in this suit. He had a vague feeling that he should play a ridiculous figure in it. On the whole, he did not know what to think of the whole affair. Superstitious, and not given to devoutness, like every soldier who is only a soldier, when he came to question himself about this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adventure_game" property="schema:name">adventure</span>, he did not feel assured as to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, as to the singular fashion in which he had met <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">La Esmeralda</span>, as to the no less strange manner in which she had allowed him to divine her love, as to her character as a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, and lastly, as to the surly monk. He perceived in all these incidents much more <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span> than love, probably a sorceress, perhaps the devil; a comedy, in short, or to speak in the language of that day, a very disagreeable mystery, in which he played a very awkward part, the role of blows and derision. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> was quite put out of countenance about it; he experienced that sort of shame which our <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_de_La_Fontaine" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">La Fontaine</span> has so admirably defined,—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">        Ashamed as a fox who has been caught by a fowl.<br/></div>
<p>Moreover, he hoped that the affair would not get noised abroad, that his name would hardly be pronounced in it, and that in any case it would not go beyond the courts of the Tournelle. In this he was not mistaken, there was then no "Gazette des Tribunaux;" and as not a week passed which had not its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Counterfeit" property="schema:name">counterfeiter</span> to boil, or its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witch</span> to hang, or its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heresy" property="schema:name">heretic</span> to burn, at some one of the innumerable justices of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, people were so accustomed to seeing in all the squares the ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feudalism" property="schema:name">feudal</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Themis" property="schema:name">Themis</span>, bare armed, with sleeves stripped up, performing her duty at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbets</span>, the ladders, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillories</span>, that they hardly paid any heed to it. Fashionable society of that day hardly knew the name of the victim who passed by at the corner of the street, and it was the populace at the most who regaled themselves with this coarse fare. An execution was an habitual incident of the public highways, like the braising-pan of the baker or the slaughter-house of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Knacker" property="schema:name">knacker</span>. The executioner was only a sort of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Butcher" property="schema:name">butcher</span> of a little deeper <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dye" property="schema:name">dye</span> than the rest.</p>
<p>Hence <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>'s mind was soon at ease on the score of the enchantress Esmeralda, or Similar, as he called her, concerning the blow from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dagger" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">dagger</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span> or of the surly monk (it mattered little which to him), and as to the issue of the trial. But as soon as his heart was vacant in that direction, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> returned to it. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_Phoebus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Captain Phoebus</span>'s heart, like the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physics" property="schema:name">physics</span> of that day, abhorred a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vacuum" property="schema:name">vacuum</span>.</p>
<p>Queue-en-Brie was a very insipid place to stay at then, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Village" property="schema:name">village</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Farrier" property="schema:name">farriers</span>, and cow-girls with chapped hands, a long line of poor dwellings and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thatching" property="schema:name">thatched</span> cottages, which borders the grand road on both sides for half a league; a tail (queue), in short, as its name imports.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> was his last passion but one, a pretty girl, a charming <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dowry" property="schema:name">dowry</span>; accordingly, one fine morning, quite cured, and assuming that, after the lapse of two months, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemianism" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span> affair must be completely finished and forgotten, the amorous cavalier arrived on a prancing horse at the door of the Gondelaurier mansion.</p>
<p>He paid no attention to a tolerably numerous rabble which had assembled in the Place du Parvis, before the portal of Notre-Dame; he remembered that it was the month of May; he supposed that it was some procession, some <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pentecost" property="schema:name">Pentecost</span>, some festival, hitched his horse to the ring at the door, and gayly ascended the stairs to his beautiful betrothed.</p>
<p>She was alone with her mother.</p>
<p>The scene of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witch</span>, her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, her cursed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alphabet" property="schema:name">alphabet</span>, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>'s long absences, still weighed on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>'s heart. Nevertheless, when she beheld her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span> enter, she thought him so handsome, his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doublet_(clothing)" property="schema:name">doublet</span> so new, his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baldric" property="schema:name">baldrick</span> so shining, and his air so impassioned, that she blushed with pleasure. The noble damsel herself was more charming than ever. Her magnificent blond hair was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Braid" property="schema:name">plaited</span> in a ravishing manner, she was dressed entirely in that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sky_blue" property="schema:name">sky blue</span> which becomes fair people so well, a bit of coquetry which she had learned from Colombe, and her eyes were swimming in that languor of love which becomes them still better.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, who had seen nothing in the line of beauty, since he left the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Village" property="schema:name">village</span> maids of Queue-en-Brie, was intoxicated with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, which imparted to our officer so eager and gallant an air, that his peace was immediately made. Madame de Gondelaurier herself, still maternally seated in her big arm-chair, had not the heart to scold him. As for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>'s reproaches, they expired in tender cooings.</p>
<p>The young girl was seated near the window still embroidering her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grotto" property="schema:name">grotto</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neptune_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Neptune</span>. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(United_States)" property="schema:name">captain</span> was leaning over the back of her chair, and she was addressing her caressing reproaches to him in a low voice.</p>
<p>"What has become of you these two long months, wicked man?"</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Swear" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">I swear</span> to you," replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, somewhat embarrassed by the question, "that you are beautiful enough to set an archbishop to dreaming."</p>
<p>She could not repress a smile.</p>
<p>"Good, good, sir. Let my beauty alone and answer my question. A fine beauty, in sooth!"</p>
<p>"Well, my dear cousin, I was recalled to the garrison.</p>
<p>"And where is that, if you please? and why did not you come to say farewell?"</p>
<p>"At Queue-en-Brie."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> was delighted with the first question, which helped him to avoid the second.</p>
<p>"But that is quite close by, monsieur. Why did you not come to see me a single time?"</p>
<p>Here <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> was rather seriously embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Because—the service—and then, charming cousin, I have been ill."</p>
<p>"Ill!" she repeated in alarm.</p>
<p>"Yes, wounded!"</p>
<p>"Wounded!"</p>
<p>She poor child was completely upset.</p>
<p>"Oh! do not be frightened at that," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, carelessly, "it was nothing. A quarrel, a sword cut; what is that to you?"</p>
<p>"What is that to me?" exclaimed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, raising her beautiful eyes filled with tears. "Oh! you do not say what you think when you speak thus. What sword cut was that? I wish to know all."</p>
<p>"Well, my dear fair one, I had a falling out with Mahè Fédy, you know? the lieutenant of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Germain-en-Laye" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Germain-en-Laye</span>, and we ripped open a few inches of skin for each other. That is all."</p>
<p>The mendacious <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> was perfectly well aware that an affair of honor always makes a man stand well in the eyes of a woman. In fact, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> looked him full in the face, all agitated with fear, pleasure, and admiration. Still, she was not completely reassured.</p>
<p>"Provided that you are wholly cured, my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>!" said she. "I do not know your Mahè Fédy, but he is a villanous man. And whence arose this quarrel?"</p>
<p>Here <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, whose imagination was endowed with but mediocre power of creation, began to find himself in a quandary as to a means of extricating himself for his prowess.</p>
<p>"Oh! how do I know?—a mere nothing, a horse, a remark! Fair cousin," he exclaimed, for the sake of changing the conversation, "what noise is this in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow_Cathedral" property="schema:name">Cathedral Square</span>?"</p>
<p>He approached the window.</p>
<p>"Oh! <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mon_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Mon</span> Dieu</i>, fair cousin, how many people there are on the Place!"</p>
<p>"I know not," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>; "it appears that a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witch</span> is to do <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Penance" property="schema:name">penance</span> this morning before the church, and thereafter to be hung."</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(naval)" property="schema:name">captain</span> was so thoroughly persuaded that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span>'s affair was concluded, that he was but little disturbed by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>'s words. Still, he asked her one or two questions.</p>
<p>"What is the name of this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witch</span>?"</p>
<p>"I do not know," she replied.</p>
<p>"And what is she said to have done?"</p>
<p>She shrugged her white shoulders.</p>
<p>"I know not."</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Jesus</span>!" said her mother; "there are so many <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witches</span> nowadays that I dare say they burn them without knowing their names. One might as well seek the name of every cloud in the sky. After all, one may be tranquil. The good <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> keeps his register." Here the venerable dame rose and came to the window. "Good Lord! you are right, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>," said she. "The rabble is indeed great. There are people on all the roofs, blessed be <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>! Do you know, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, this reminds me of my best days. The entrance of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_VII_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">King Charles VII</span>., when, also, there were many people. I no longer remember in what year that was. When I speak of this to you, it produces upon you the effect,—does it not?—the effect of something very old, and upon me of something very young. Oh! the crowd was far finer than at the present day. They even stood upon the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Machicolation" property="schema:name">machicolations</span> of the Porte Sainte-Antoine. The king had the queen on a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillion" property="schema:name">pillion</span>, and after their highnesses came all the ladies mounted behind all the lords. I remember that they laughed loudly, because beside Amanyon de Garlande, who was very short of stature, there rode the Sire Matefelon, a chevalier of gigantic size, who had killed heaps of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">English</span>. It was very fine. A procession of all the gentlemen of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>, with their oriflammes waving <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red_hair" property="schema:name">red</span> before the eye. There were some with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennon" property="schema:name">pennons</span> and some with banners. How can I tell? the Sire de Calm with a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennon" property="schema:name">pennon</span>; Jean de Châteaumorant with a banner; the Sire de Courcy with a banner, and a more ample one than any of the others except the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duke_of_Bourbon" property="schema:name">Duc de Bourbon</span>. Alas! 'tis a sad thing to think that all that has existed and exists no longer!"</p>
<p>The two lovers were not listening to the venerable dowager. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> had returned and was leaning on the back of his betrothed's chair, a charming post whence his libertine glance plunged into all the openings of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>'s <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gorget" property="schema:name">gorget</span>. This <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gorget" property="schema:name">gorget</span> gaped so conveniently, and allowed him to see so many exquisite things and to divine so many more, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, dazzled by this skin with its gleams of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satin" property="schema:name">satin</span>, said to himself, "How can any one love anything but a fair skin?"</p>
<p>Both were <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span>. The young girl raised sweet, enraptured eyes to him from time to time, and their hair mingled in a ray of spring sunshine.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> suddenly, in a low voice, "we are to be married three months hence; swear to me that you have never loved any other woman than myself."</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Swear" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">I swear</span> it, fair angel!" replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, and his passionate glances aided the sincere tone of his voice in convincing <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the good mother, charmed to see the betrothed pair on terms of such perfect understanding, had just quitted the apartment to attend to some domestic matter; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> observed it, and this so emboldened the adventurous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> that very strange ideas mounted to his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brain" property="schema:name">brain</span>. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> loved him, he was her betrothed; she was alone with him; his former taste for her had re-awakened, not with all its fresh-ness but with all its ardor; after all, there is no great harm in tasting one's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wheat" property="schema:name">wheat</span> while it is still in the blade; I do not know whether these ideas passed through his mind, but one thing is certain, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> was suddenly alarmed by the expression of his glance. She looked round and saw that her mother was no longer there.</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" said she, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blushing" property="schema:name">blushing</span> and uneasy, "how very warm I am?"</p>
<p>"I think, in fact," replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, "that it cannot be far from midday. The sun is troublesome. We need only lower the curtains."</p>
<p>"No, no," exclaimed the poor little thing, "on the contrary, I need air."</p>
<p>And like a fawn who feels the breath of the pack of hounds, she rose, ran to the window, opened it, and rushed upon the balcony.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, much discomfited, followed her.</p>
<p>The Place du Parvis Notre-Dame, upon which the balcony looked, as the reader knows, presented at that moment a singular and sinister spectacle which caused the fright of the timid <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> to change its nature.</p>
<p>An immense crowd, which overflowed into all the neighboring streets, encumbered the Place, properly speaking. The little wall, breast high, which surrounded the Place, would not have sufficed to keep it free had it not been lined with a thick <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hedge" property="schema:name">hedge</span> of sergeants and hackbuteers, culverines in hand. Thanks to this thicket of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pike_(weapon)" property="schema:name">pikes</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arquebus" property="schema:name">arquebuses</span>, the Parvis was empty. Its entrance was guarded by a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Halberd" property="schema:name">halberdiers</span> with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coat_of_arms" property="schema:name">armorial bearings</span> of the bishop. The large doors of the church were closed, and formed a contrast with the innumerable windows on the Place, which, open to their very <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gable" property="schema:name">gables</span>, allowed a view of thousands of heads heaped up almost like the piles of bullets in a park of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artillery" property="schema:name">artillery</span>.</p>
<p>The surface of this rabble was dingy, dirty, earthy. The spectacle which it was expecting was evidently one of the sort which possess the privilege of bringing out and calling together the vilest among the populace. Nothing is so hideous as the noise which was made by that swarm of yellow caps and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Dirty_Heads" property="schema:name">dirty heads</span>. In that throng there were more laughs than cries, more women than men.</p>
<p>From time to time, a sharp and vibrating voice pierced the general clamor.</p>
<p>"Ohé! Mahiet Baliffre! Is she to be hung yonder?"</p>
<p>"Fool! t'is here that she is to make her apology in her shift! the good <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> is going to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cough" property="schema:name">cough</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span> in her face! That is always done here, at midday. If 'tis the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallows" property="schema:name">gallows</span> that you wish, go to the Grève."</p>
<p>"I will go there, afterwards."</p>
<p>"Tell me, la Boucanbry? Is it true that she has refused a confessor?"</p>
<p>"It appears so, La Bechaigne."</p>
<p>"You see what a pagan she is!"</p>
<p>"'Tis the custom, monsieur. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> of the courts is bound to deliver the malefactor ready judged for execution if he be a layman, to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cathedral" property="schema:name">provost</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>; if a clerk, to the official of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bishop" property="schema:name">bishopric</span>."</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oh,_God!" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">Oh, God!</span>" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, "the poor creature!"</p>
<p>This thought filled with sadness the glance which she cast upon the populace. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>, much more occupied with her than with that pack of the rabble, was amorously rumpling her girdle behind. She turned round, entreating and smiling.</p>
<p>"Please let me alone, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>! If my mother were to return, she would see your hand!"</p>
<p>At that moment, midday rang slowly out from the clock of Notre-Dame. A murmur of satisfaction broke out in the crowd. The last vibration of the twelfth <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stroke" property="schema:name">stroke</span> had hardly died away when all heads surged like the waves beneath a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Squall" property="schema:name">squall</span>, and an immense shout went up from the pavement, the windows, and the roofs,</p>
<p>"There she is!"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> pressed her hands to her eyes, that she might not see.</p>
<p>"Charming girl," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, "do you wish to withdraw?"</p>
<p>"No," she replied; and she opened through curiosity, the eyes which she had closed through fear.</p>
<p>A <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tumbrel" property="schema:name">tumbrel</span> drawn by a stout Norman horse, and all surrounded by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry" property="schema:name">cavalry</span> in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violet_(color)" property="schema:name">violet</span> livery with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/White_Crosses_(album)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">white crosses</span>, had just <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Debouch" property="schema:name">debouched</span> upon the Place through the Rue Saint-Pierre-aux-Boeufs. The sergeants of the watch were clearing a passage for it through the crowd, by stout blows from their clubs. Beside the cart rode several officers of justice and police, recognizable by their black costume and their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/AWK" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">awk</span>wardness in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saddle" property="schema:name">saddle</span>. Master Jacques Charmolue paraded at their head.</p>
<p>In the fatal cart sat a young girl with her arms tied behind her back, and with no priest beside her. She was in her shift; her long black hair (the fashion then was to cut it off only at the foot of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallows" property="schema:name">gallows</span>) fell in disorder upon her half-bared throat and shoulders.</p>
<p>Athwart that waving hair, more glossy than the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feather" property="schema:name">plumage</span> of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raven" property="schema:name">raven</span>, a thick, rough, gray rope was visible, twisted and knotted, chafing her delicate collar-bones and twining round the charming neck of the poor girl, like an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earthworm" property="schema:name">earthworm</span> round a flower. Beneath that rope glittered a tiny <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amulet" property="schema:name">amulet</span> ornamented with bits of green glass, which had been left to her no doubt, because nothing is refused to those who are about to die. The spectators in the windows could see in the bottom of the cart her naked legs which she strove to hide beneath her, as by a final feminine instinct. At her feet lay a little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, bound. The condemned girl held together with her teeth her imperfectly fastened shift. One would have said that she suffered still more in her misery from being thus exposed almost naked to the eyes of all. Alas! modesty is not made for such shocks.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Jesus</span>!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> hastily to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>. "Look fair cousin, 'tis that wretched <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemianism" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span> with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>."</p>
<p>So saying, she turned to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>. His eyes were fixed on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tumbrel" property="schema:name">tumbrel</span>. He was very pale.</p>
<p>"What <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemianism" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span> with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>?" he stammered.</p>
<p>"What!" resumed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, "do you not remember?"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> interrupted her.</p>
<p>"I do not know what you mean."</p>
<p>He made a step to re-enter the room, but <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, whose jealousy, previously so vividly aroused by this same <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, had just been re-awakened, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> gave him a look full of penetration and distrust. She vaguely recalled at that moment having heard of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> mixed up in the trial of that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witch</span>.</p>
<p>"What is the matter with you?" she said to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, "one would say, that this woman had disturbed you."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> forced a sneer,—</p>
<p>"Me! Not the least in the world! Ah! yes, certainly!"</p>
<p>"Remain, then!" she continued imperiously, "and let us see the end."</p>
<p>The unlucky <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> was obliged to remain. He was somewhat reassured by the fact that the condemned girl never removed her eyes from the bottom of the cart. It was but too surely <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span>. In this last stage of opprobrium and misfortune, she was still beautiful; her great black eyes appeared still larger, because of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emaciation" property="schema:name">emaciation</span> of her cheeks; her pale profile was pure and sublime. She resembled what she had been, in the same degree that a virgin by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Masaccio" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Masaccio</span>, resembles a virgin of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raphael" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Raphael</span>,—weaker, thinner, more delicate.</p>
<p>Moreover, there was nothing in her which was not shaken in some sort, and which with the exception of her modesty, she did not let go at will, so profoundly had she been broken by stupor and despair. Her body bounded at every jolt of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tumbrel" property="schema:name">tumbrel</span> like a dead or broken thing; her gaze was dull and imbecile. A tear was still visible in her eyes, but motionless and frozen, so to speak.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the lugubrious cavalcade has traversed the crowd amid cries of joy and curious attitudes. But as a faithful historian, we must state that on beholding her so beautiful, so depressed, many were moved with pity, even among the hardest of them.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tumbrel" property="schema:name">tumbrel</span> had entered the Parvis.</p>
<p>It halted before the central portal. The escort ranged themselves in line on both sides. The crowd became <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span>, and, in the midst of this silence full of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anxiety" property="schema:name">anxiety</span> and solemnity, the two leaves of the grand door swung back, as of themselves, on their hinges, which gave a creak like the sound of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fife" property="schema:name">fife</span>. Then there became visible in all its length, the deep, gloomy church, hung in black, sparely lighted with a few candles gleaming <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afar_people" property="schema:name">afar</span> off on the principal altar, opened in the midst of the Place which was dazzling with light, like the mouth of a cavern. At the very extremity, in the gloom of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apse" property="schema:name">apse</span>, a gigantic silver cross was visible against a black drapery which hung from the vault to the pavement. The whole <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nave" property="schema:name">nave</span> was deserted. But a few heads of priests could be seen moving confusedly in the distant <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choir_(architecture)" property="schema:name">choir stalls</span>, and, at the moment when the great door opened, there escaped from the church a loud, solemn, and monotonous chanting, which cast over the head of the condemned girl, in gusts, fragments of melancholy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Psalms" property="schema:name">psalms</span>,—</p>
<p>"<i>Non timebo millia populi circumdantis me: exsurge, Domine; salvum me fac, Deus</i>!"</p>
<p>"<i>Salvum me fac, Deus, quoniam intraverunt aquae usque ad animam meam</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>Infixus sum in limo profundi; et non est substantia</i>."</p>
<p>At the same time, another voice, separate from the choir, intoned upon the steps of the chief altar, this melancholy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Offertory" property="schema:name">offertory</span>,—"<i>Qui verbum meum audit, et credit ei qui misit me, habet vitam oeternam et in judicium non venit; sed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Transit_(astronomy)" property="schema:name">transit</span> a morte im vitam</i>*."</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     * "He that heareth my word and believeth on Him that sent me,<br/>hath eternal life, and hath not come into condemnation; but is passed<br/>from death to life."<br/></div>
<p>This chant, which a few old men buried in the gloom sang from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afar_people" property="schema:name">afar</span> over that beautiful creature, full of youth and life, caressed by the warm air of spring, inundated with sunlight was the mass for the dead.</p>
<p>The people listened devoutly.</p>
<p>The unhappy girl seemed to lose her sight and her consciousness in the obscure interior of the church. Her white lips moved as though in prayer, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Executioner" property="schema:name">headsman</span>'s assistant who approached to assist her to alight from the cart, heard her repeating this word in a low tone,—"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>."</p>
<p>They untied her hands, made her alight, accompanied by her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, which had also been unbound, and which bleated with joy at finding itself free: and they made her walk barefoot on the hard pavement to the foot of the steps leading to the door. The rope about her neck trailed behind her. One would have said it was a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serpent_(symbolism)" property="schema:name">serpent</span> following her.</p>
<p>Then the chanting in the church ceased. A great golden cross and a row of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wax" property="schema:name">wax</span> candles began to move through the gloom. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battle_of_Halbe" typeof="schema:Event" property="schema:name">halbe</span><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Dublin_Society" property="schema:name">rds</span> of the motley <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beadle" property="schema:name">beadles</span> clanked; and, a few moments later, a long procession of priests in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chasuble" property="schema:name">chasubles</span>, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">deacons</span> in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dalmatic" property="schema:name">dalmatics</span>, marched gravely towards the condemned girl, as they drawled their song, spread out before her view and that of the crowd. But her glance rested on the one who marched at the head, immediately after the cross-bearer.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she said in a low voice, and with a shudder, "'tis he again! the priest!"</p>
<p>It was in fact, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>. On his left he had the sub-chanter, on his right, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cantor_(church)" property="schema:name">chanter</span>, armed with his official <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wand" property="schema:name">wand</span>. He advanced with head thrown back, his eyes fixed and wide open, intoning in a strong voice,—</p>
<p>"<i>De ventre <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_in_Harry_Potter" property="schema:name">inferi</span> clamavi, et exaudisti vocem meam</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>Et projecisti me in profundum in corde mans, et flumem circumdedit me</i>*."</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  "Out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest<br/>my voice. For thou hadst cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas,<br/>and the floods compassed me about."<br/></div>
<p>At the moment when he made his appearance in the full daylight beneath the lofty arched portal, enveloped in an ample cope of silver barred with a black cross, he was so pale that more than one person in the crowd thought that one of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> bishops who knelt on the sepulchral stones of the choir had risen and was come to receive upon the brink of the tomb, the woman who was about to die.</p>
<p>She, no less pale, no less like a statue, had hardly noticed that they had placed in her hand a heavy, lighted candle of yellow <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wax" property="schema:name">wax</span>; she had not heard the yelping voice of the clerk reading the fatal contents of the apology; when they told her to respond with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amen" property="schema:name">Amen</span>, she responded <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amen" property="schema:name">Amen</span>. She only recovered life and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span> when she beheld the priest make a sign to her guards to withdraw, and himself advance alone towards her.</p>
<p>Then she felt her blood boil in her head, and a remnant of indignation flashed up in that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> already benumbed and cold.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> approached her slowly; even in that extremity, she beheld him cast an eye sparkling with sensuality, jealousy, and desire, over her exposed form. Then he said aloud,—</p>
<p>"Young girl, have you asked <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>'s pardon for your faults and shortcomings?"</p>
<p>He bent down to her ear, and added (the spectators supposed that he was receiving her last confession): "Will you have me? I can still save you!"</p>
<p>She looked intently at him: "Begone, demon, or I will denounce you!"</p>
<p>He gave vent to a horrible smile: "You will not be believed. You will only add a scandal to a crime. Reply quickly! Will you have me?"</p>
<p>"What have you done with my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>?"</p>
<p>"He is dead!" said the priest.</p>
<p>At that moment the wretched <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> raised his head mechanically and beheld at the other end of the Place, in the balcony of the Gondelaurier mansion, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> standing beside <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>. He staggered, passed his hand across his eyes, looked again, muttered a curse, and all his features were violently contorted.</p>
<p>"Well, die then!" he hissed between his teeth. "No one shall have you." Then, raising his hand over the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gray_(unit)" property="schema:name">gy</span>psy, he exclaimed in a funereal voice:—"<i>I nunc, anima <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anceps" property="schema:name">anceps</span>, et sit tibi Deus misenicors</i>!"*</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  "Go now, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, trembling in the balance, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> have mercy<br/>upon thee."<br/></div>
<p>This was the dread formula with which it was the custom to conclude these gloomy ceremonies. It was the signal agreed upon between the priest and the executioner.</p>
<p>The crowd knelt.</p>
<p>"<i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kyrie" property="schema:name">Kyrie eleison</span></i>,"* said the priests, who had remained beneath the arch of the portal.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  "Lord have mercy upon us."<br/></div>
<p>"<i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kyrie" property="schema:name">Kyrie eleison</span></i>," repeated the throng in that murmur which runs over all heads, like the waves of a troubled sea.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amen" property="schema:name">Amen</span>," said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>.</p>
<p>He turned his back on the condemned girl, his head sank upon his breast once more, he crossed his hands and rejoined his escort of priests, and a moment later he was seen to disappear, with the cross, the candles, and the copes, beneath the misty arches of the cathedral, and his sonorous voice was extinguished by degrees in the choir, as he chanted this verse of despair,—</p>
<p>"<i>Omnes gurgites tui et <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planetary_nomenclature" property="schema:name">fluctus</span> tui super me transierunt</i>."*</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  "All thy waves and thy billows have gone over me."<br/></div>
<p>At the same time, the intermittent clash of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> butts of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beadle" property="schema:name">beadles</span>' <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Halberd" property="schema:name">halberds</span>, gradually dying away among the columns of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nave" property="schema:name">nave</span>, produced the effect of a clock <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hammer" property="schema:name">hammer</span> striking the last hour of the condemned.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Doors" property="schema:name">The doors</span> of Notre-Dame remained open, allowing a view of the empty desolate church, draped in mourning, without candles, and without voices.</p>
<p>The condemned girl remained motionless in her place, waiting to be disposed of. One of the sergeants of police was obliged to notify Master Charmolue of the fact, as the latter, during this entire scene, had been engaged in studying the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Relief" property="schema:name">bas-relief</span> of the grand portal which represents, according to some, the sacrifice of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abraham" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Abraham</span>; according to others, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span>'s <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alchemy" property="schema:name">alchemical</span> operation: the sun being figured forth by the angel; the fire, by the fagot; the artisan, by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abraham" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Abraham</span>.</p>
<p>There was considerable difficulty in drawing him away from that contemplation, but at length he turned round; and, at a signal which he gave, two men clad in yellow, the executioner's assistants, approached the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> to bind her hands once more.</p>
<p>The unhappy creature, at the moment of mounting once again the fatal cart, and proceeding to her last halting-place, was seized, possibly, with some poignant clinging to life. She raised her dry, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> eyes to heaven, to the sun, to the silvery clouds, cut here and there by a blue <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trapezoid" property="schema:name">trapezium</span> or <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triangle" property="schema:name">triangle</span>; then she lowered them to objects around her, to the earth, the throng, the houses; all at once, while the yellow man was binding her elbows, she uttered a terrible cry, a cry of joy. Yonder, on that balcony, at the corner of the Place, she had just caught sight of him, of her friend, her lord, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, the other apparition of her life!</p>
<p>The judge had lied! the priest had lied! it was certainly he, she could not doubt it; he was there, handsome, alive, dressed in his brilliant uniform, his plume on his head, his sword by his side!</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>!" she cried, "my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>!"</p>
<p>And she tried to stretch towards him arms trembling with love and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rapture" property="schema:name">rapture</span>, but they were bound.</p>
<p>Then she saw the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> frown, a beautiful young girl who was leaning against him gazed at him with disdainful lips and irritated eyes; then <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> uttered some words which did not reach her, and both disappeared precipitately behind the window opening upon the balcony, which closed after them.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>!" she cried wildly, "can it be you believe it?" A monstrous thought had just presented itself to her. She remembered that she had been condemned to death for murder committed on the person of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> de Châteaupers.</p>
<p>She had borne up until that moment. But this last blow was too harsh. She fell lifeless on the pavement.</p>
<p>"Come," said Charmolue, "carry her to the cart, and make an end of it."</p>
<p>No one had yet observed in the gallery of the statues of the kings, carved directly above the arches of the portal, a strange spectator, who had, up to that time, observed everything with such impassiveness, with a neck so strained, a visage so hideous that, in his motley accoutrement of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viola_(plant)" property="schema:name">violet</span>, he might have been taken for one of those stone monsters through whose mouths the long gutters of the cathedral have discharged their waters for six hundred years. This spectator had missed nothing that had taken place since midday in front of the portal of Notre-Dame. And at the very beginning he had securely fastened to one of the small columns a large knotted rope, one end of which trailed on the flight of steps below. This being done, he began to look on tranquilly, whistling from time to time when a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Common_Blackbird" property="schema:name">blackbird</span> flitted past. Suddenly, at the moment when the superintendent's assistants were preparing to execute Charmolue's phlegmatic order, he threw his leg over the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span> of the gallery, seized the rope with his feet, his knees and his hands; then he was seen to glide down the façade, as a drop of rain slips down a window-pane, rush to the two executioners with the swiftness of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" property="schema:name">cat</span> which has fallen from a roof, knock them down with two enormous fists, pick up the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> with one hand, as a child would her doll, and dash back into the church with a single bound, lifting the young girl above his head and crying in a formidable voice,—</p>
<p>"Sanctuary!"</p>
<p>This was done with such rapidity, that had it taken place at night, the whole of it could have been seen in the space of a single flash of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lightning" property="schema:name">lightning</span>.</p>
<p>"Sanctuary! Sanctuary!" repeated the crowd; and the clapping of ten thousand hands made <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>'s single eye <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparkle_(1976_film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">sparkle</span> with joy and pride.</p>
<p>This shock restored the condemned girl to her senses. She raised her eyelids, looked at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, then closed them again suddenly, as though terrified by her deliverer.</p>
<p>Charmolue was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stupefied" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">stupefied</span>, as well as the executioners and the entire escort. In fact, within the bounds of Notre-Dame, the condemned girl could not be touched. The cathedral was a place of refuge. All temporal jurisdiction expired upon its threshold.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had halted beneath the great portal, his huge feet seemed as solid on the pavement of the church as the heavy Roman pillars. His great, bushy head sat low between his shoulders, like the heads of lions, who also have a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lion" property="schema:name">mane</span> and no neck. He held the young girl, who was quivering all over, suspended from his horny hands like a white drapery; but he carried her with as much care as though he feared to break her or blight her. One would have said that he felt that she was a delicate, exquisite, precious thing, made for other hands than his. There were moments when he looked as if not daring to touch her, even with his breath. Then, all at once, he would press her forcibly in his arms, against his angular bosom, like his own possession, his treasure, as the mother of that child would have done. His <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gnome" property="schema:name">gnome</span>'s eye, fastened upon her, inundated her with tenderness, sadness, and pity, and was suddenly raised filled with lightnings. Then the women laughed and wept, the crowd stamped with enthusiasm, for, at that moment <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had a beauty of his own. He was handsome; he, that orphan, that foundling, that outcast, he felt himself august and strong, he gazed in the face of that society from which he was banished, and in which he had so powerfully intervened, of that human justice from which he had wrenched its prey, of all those <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiger" property="schema:name">tigers</span> whose jaws were forced to remain empty, of those policemen, those judges, those executioners, of all that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span> of the king which he, the meanest of creatures, had just broken, with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>.</p>
<p>And then, it was touching to behold this protection which had fallen from a being so hideous upon a being so unhappy, a creature condemned to death saved by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. They were two extremes of natural and social wretchedness, coming into contact and aiding each other.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, after several moments of triumph, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had plunged abruptly into the church with his burden. The populace, fond of all prowess, sought him with their eyes, beneath the gloomy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nave" property="schema:name">nave</span>, regretting that he had so speedily disappeared from their acclamations. All at once, he was seen to re-appear at one of the extremities of the gallery of the kings of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>; he traversed it, running like a madman, raising his conquest high in his arms and shouting: "Sanctuary!" The crowd broke forth into fresh applause. The gallery passed, he plunged once more into the interior of the church. A moment later, he re-appeared upon the upper platform, with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> still in his arms, still running madly, still crying, "Sanctuary!" and the throng applauded. Finally, he made his appearance for the third time upon the summit of the tower where hung the great bell; from that point he seemed to be showing to the entire city the girl whom he had saved, and his voice of thunder, that voice which was so rarely heard, and which he never heard himself, repeated thrice with frenzy, even to the clouds: "Sanctuary! Sanctuary! Sanctuary!"</p>
<p>"Noel! Noel!" shouted the populace in its turn; and that immense <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acclamation" property="schema:name">acclamation</span> flew to astonish the crowd assembled at the Grève on the other <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank" property="schema:name">bank</span>, and the recluse who was still waiting with her eyes riveted on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span>.</p>

<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> was no longer in Notre-Dame when his adopted son so abruptly cut the fatal web in which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/False_hero" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> were entangled. On returning to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sacristy" property="schema:name">sacristy</span> he had torn off his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alb" property="schema:name">alb</span>, cope, and stole, had flung all into the hands of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stupefied" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">stupefied</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beadle" property="schema:name">beadle</span>, had made his escape through the private door of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span>, had ordered a boatman of the Terrain to transport him to the left <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank" property="schema:name">bank</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>, and had plunged into the hilly streets of the University, not knowing whither he was going, encountering at every step groups of men and women who were hurrying joyously towards the Pont Saint-Michel, in the hope of still arriving in time to see the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witch</span> hung there,—pale, wild, more troubled, more blind and more fierce than a night <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">bird</span> let loose and pursued by a troop of children in broad daylight. He no longer knew where he was, what he thought, or whether he were dreaming. He went forward, walking, running, taking any street at haphazard, making no choice, only urged ever onward away from the Grève, the horrible Grève, which he felt confusedly, to be behind him.</p>
<p>In this manner he skirted Mount <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genevieve" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Sainte-Geneviève</span>, and finally emerged from the town by the Porte Saint-Victor. He continued his flight as long as he could see, when he turned round, the turreted enclosure of the University, and the rare houses of the suburb; but, when, at length, a rise of ground had completely concealed from him that odious <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, when he could believe himself to be a hundred leagues distant from it, in the fields, in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Desert" property="schema:name">desert</span>, he halted, and it seemed to him that he breathed more freely.</p>
<p>Then frightful ideas thronged his mind. Once more he could see clearly into his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, and he shuddered. He thought of that unhappy girl who had destroyed him, and whom he had destroyed. He cast a haggard eye over the double, tortuous way which fate had caused their two destinies to pursue up to their point of intersection, where it had dashed them against each other without mercy. He meditated on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folly" property="schema:name">folly</span> of eternal vows, on the vanity of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chastity" property="schema:name">chastity</span>, of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span>, of religion, of virtue, on the uselessness of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>. He plunged to his heart's content in evil thoughts, and in proportion as he sank deeper, he felt a Satanic laugh burst forth within him.</p>
<p>And as he thus sifted his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> to the bottom, when he perceived how large a space nature had prepared there for the passions, he sneered still more bitterly. He stirred up in the depths of his heart all his hatred, all his malevolence; and, with the cold glance of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span> who examines a patient, he recognized the fact that this malevolence was nothing but vitiated love; that love, that source of every virtue in man, turned to horrible things in the heart of a priest, and that a man constituted like himself, in making himself a priest, made himself a demon. Then he laughed frightfully, and suddenly became pale again, when he considered the most sinister side of his fatal passion, of that corrosive, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venom" property="schema:name">venomous</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer" property="schema:name">malignant</span>, implacable love, which had ended only in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span> for one of them and in hell for the other; condemnation for her, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hell" property="schema:name">damnation</span> for him.</p>
<p>And then his laughter came again, when he reflected that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> was alive; that after all, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> lived, was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homosexuality" property="schema:name">gay</span> and happy, had handsomer doublets than ever, and a new mistress whom he was conducting to see the old one hanged. His sneer redoubled its bitterness when he reflected that out of the living beings whose death he had desired, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, the only creature whom he did not hate, was the only one who had not escaped him.</p>
<p>Then from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>, his thought passed to the people, and there came to him a jealousy of an unprecedented sort. He reflected that the people also, the entire populace, had had before their eyes the woman whom he loved exposed almost naked. He writhed his arms with agony as he thought that the woman whose form, caught by him alone in the darkness would have been supreme <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Happiness" property="schema:name">happiness</span>, had been delivered up in broad daylight at full noonday, to a whole people, clad as for a night of voluptuousness. He wept with rage over all these mysteries of love, profaned, soiled, laid bare, withered forever. He wept with rage as he pictured to himself how many impure looks had been gratified at the sight of that badly fastened shift, and that this beautiful girl, this virgin lily, this cup of modesty and delight, to which he would have dared to place his lips only trembling, had just been transformed into a sort of public bowl, whereat the vilest populace of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, thieves, beggars, lackeys, had come to quaff in common an audacious, impure, and depraved pleasure.</p>
<p>And when he sought to picture to himself the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Happiness" property="schema:name">happiness</span> which he might have found upon earth, if she had not been a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, and if he had not been a priest, if <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> had not existed and if she had loved him; when he pictured to himself that a life of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serenity_(film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">serenity</span> and love would have been possible to him also, even to him; that there were at that very moment, here and there upon the earth, happy couples spending the hours in sweet converse beneath <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orange_(fruit)" property="schema:name">orange trees</span>, on the banks of brooks, in the presence of a setting sun, of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Starry_Night" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">starry night</span>; and that if <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> had so willed, he might have formed with her one of those blessed couples,—his heart melted in tenderness and despair.</p>
<p>Oh! she! still she! It was this fixed idea which returned incessantly, which tortured him, which ate into his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brain" property="schema:name">brain</span>, and rent his vitals. He did not regret, he did not repent; all that he had done he was ready to do again; he preferred to behold her in the hands of the executioner rather than in the arms of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(naval)" property="schema:name">captain</span>. But he suffered; he suffered so that at intervals he tore out handfuls of his hair to see whether it were not turning white.</p>
<p>Among other moments there came one, when it occurred to him that it was perhaps the very minute when the hideous chain which he had seen that morning, was pressing its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> noose closer about that frail and graceful neck. This thought caused the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perspiration" property="schema:name">perspiration</span> to start from every pore.</p>
<p>There was another moment when, while laughing diabolically at himself, he represented to himself <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span> as he had seen her on that first day, lively, careless, joyous, gayly attired, dancing, winged, harmonious, and la <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">Esmeralda</span> of the last day, in her scanty shift, with a rope about her neck, mounting slowly with her bare feet, the angular ladder of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallows" property="schema:name">gallows</span>; he figured to himself this double picture in such a manner that he gave vent to a terrible cry.</p>
<p>While this hurricane of despair overturned, broke, tore up, bent, uprooted everything in his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, he gazed at nature around him. At his feet, some chickens were searching the thickets and pecking, enamelled <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beetle" property="schema:name">beetles</span> ran about in the sun; overhead, some groups of dappled gray clouds were floating across the blue sky; on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horus" property="schema:name">horizon</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span> of the Abbey Saint-Victor pierced the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ridge" property="schema:name">ridge</span> of the hill with its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slate" property="schema:name">slate</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Obelisk" property="schema:name">obelisk</span>; and the miller of the Copeaue hillock was whistling as he watched the laborious wings of his mill turning. All this active, organized, tranquil life, recurring around him under a thousand forms, hurt him. He resumed his flight.</p>
<p>He sped thus across the fields until <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electronvolt" property="schema:name">ev</span>ening. This flight from nature, life, himself, man, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>, everything, lasted all day long. Sometimes he flung himself face downward on the earth, and tore up the young blades of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wheat" property="schema:name">wheat</span> with his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nail_(anatomy)" property="schema:name">nails</span>. Sometimes he halted in the deserted street of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Village" property="schema:name">village</span>, and his thoughts were so intolerable that he grasped his head in both hands and tried to tear it from his shoulders in order to dash it upon the pavement.</p>
<p>Towards the hour of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sunset" property="schema:name">sunset</span>, he examined himself again, and found himself nearly mad. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Tempest" property="schema:name">The tempest</span> which had raged within him ever since the instant when he had lost the hope and the will to save the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>,—that tempest had not left in his conscience a single healthy idea, a single thought which maintained its upright position. His reason lay there almost entirely destroyed. There remained but two distinct images in his mind, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallows" property="schema:name">gallows</span>; all the rest was blank. Those two images united, presented to him a frightful group; and the more he concentrated what attention and thought was left to him, the more he beheld them grow, in accordance with a fantastic progression, the one in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_grace" property="schema:name">grace</span>, in charm, in beauty, in light, the other in deformity and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horror_film" property="schema:name">horror</span>; so that at last <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span> appeared to him like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Star" property="schema:name">star</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span> like an enormous, fleshless arm.</p>
<p>One remarkable fact is, that during the whole of this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Torture" property="schema:name">torture</span>, the idea of dying did not seriously occur to him. The wretch was made so. He clung to life. Perhaps he really saw hell beyond it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the day continued to decline. The living being which still existed in him reflected vaguely on retracing its steps. He believed himself to be far away from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>; on taking his bearings, he perceived that he had only circled the enclosure of the University. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sulpitius_the_Pious" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint-Sulpice</span>, and the three lofty needles of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Germain-des-Prés" property="schema:name">Saint Germain-des-Prés</span>, rose above the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horus" property="schema:name">horizon</span> on his right. He turned his steps in that direction. When he heard the brisk challenge of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Man-at-arms" property="schema:name">men-at-arms</span> of the abbey, around the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battlement" property="schema:name">crenelated</span>, circumscribing wall of Saint-Germain, he turned aside, took a path which presented itself between the abbey and the lazar-house of the bourg, and at the expiration of a few minutes found himself on the verge of the Pré-aux-Clercs. This meadow was celebrated by reason of the brawls which went on there night and day; it was the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lernaean_Hydra" property="schema:name">hydra</span> of the poor monks of Saint-Germain: <i>quod mouachis Sancti-Germaini pratensis <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lernaean_Hydra" property="schema:name">hydra</span> fuit, clericis nova semper dissidiorum capita suscitantibus</i>. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> was afraid of meeting some one there; he feared every human countenance; he had just avoided the University and the Bourg Saint-Germain; he wished to re-enter the streets as late as possible. He skirted the Pré-aux-Clercs, took the deserted path which separated it from the Dieu-Neuf, and at last reached the water's edge. There Dom Claude found a boatman, who, for a few farthings in Parisian coinage, rowed him up the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span> as far as the point of the city, and landed him on that tongue of abandoned land where the reader has already beheld <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> dreaming, and which was prolonged beyond the king's gardens, parallel to the Ile du Passeur-aux-Vaches.</p>
<p>The monotonous rocking of the boat and the ripple of the water had, in some sort, quieted the unhappy Claude. When the boatman had taken his departure, he remained standing stupidly on the strand, staring straight before him and perceiving objects only through magnifying oscillations which rendered everything a sort of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phantasmagoria" property="schema:name">phantasmagoria</span> to him. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fatigue_(material)" property="schema:name">fatigue</span> of a great grief not infrequently produces this effect on the mind.</p>
<p>The sun had set behind the lofty Tour-de-Nesle. It was the twilight hour. The sky was white, the water of the river was white. Between these two white expanses, the left <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flight_dynamics_(fixed-wing_aircraft)" property="schema:name">bank</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>, on which his eyes were fixed, projected its gloomy mass and, rendered ever thinner and thinner by perspective, it plunged into the gloom of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Event_horizon" property="schema:name">horizon</span> like a black <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span>. It was loaded with houses, of which only the obscure outline could be distinguished, sharply brought out in shadows against the light background of the sky and the water. Here and there windows began to gleam, like the holes in a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazier" property="schema:name">brazier</span>. That immense <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Obelisk_of_Shalmaneser_III" property="schema:name">black obelisk</span> thus isolated between the two white expanses of the sky and the river, which was very broad at this point, produced upon Dom Claude a singular effect, comparable to that which would be experienced by a man who, reclining on his back at the foot of the tower of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strasbourg" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Strasburg</span>, should gaze at the enormous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span> plunging into the shadows of the twilight above his head. Only, in this case, it was Claude who was erect and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Obelisk" property="schema:name">obelisk</span> which was lying down; but, as the river, reflecting the sky, prolonged the abyss below him, the immense <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Promontory" property="schema:name">promontory</span> seemed to be as boldly launched into space as any cathedral <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span>; and the impression was the same. This impression had even one stronger and more profound point about it, that it was indeed the tower of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strasbourg" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Strasbourg</span>, but the tower of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strasbourg" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Strasbourg</span> two leagues in height; something unheard of, gigantic, immeasurable; an edifice such as no human eye has ever seen; a tower of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tower_of_Babel" property="schema:name">Babel</span>. The chimneys of the houses, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battlement" property="schema:name">battlements</span> of the walls, the faceted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gable" property="schema:name">gables</span> of the roofs, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span> of the Augustines, the tower of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nesle" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Nesle</span>, all these projections which broke the profile of the colossal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Obelisk" property="schema:name">obelisk</span> added to the illusion by displaying in eccentric fashion to the eye the indentations of a luxuriant and fantastic sculpture.</p>
<p>Claude, in the state of hallucination in which he found himself, believed that he saw, that he saw with his actual eyes, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell tower</span> of hell; the thousand lights scattered over the whole height of the terrible tower seemed to him so many porches of the immense interior <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span>; the voices and noises which escaped from it seemed so many shrieks, so many death groans. Then he became alarmed, he put his hands on his ears that he might no longer hear, turned his back that he might no longer see, and fled from the frightful vision with hasty strides.</p>
<p>But the vision was in himself.</p>
<p>When he re-entered the streets, the passers-by elbowing each other by the light of the shop-fronts, produced upon him the effect of a constant going and coming of spectres about him. There were strange noises in his ears; extraordinary fancies disturbed his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brain" property="schema:name">brain</span>. He saw neither houses, nor pavements, nor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chariot" property="schema:name">chariots</span>, nor men and women, but a chaos of indeterminate objects whose edges melted into each other. At the corner of the Rue de la Barillerie, there was a grocer's shop whose porch was garnished all about, according to immemorial custom, with hoops of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tin" property="schema:name">tin</span> from which hung a circle of wooden candles, which came in contact with each other in the wind, and rattled like <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castanets" property="schema:name">castanets</span>. He thought he heard a cluster of skeletons at Montfauçon clashing together in the gloom.</p>
<p>"Oh!" he muttered, "the night breeze dashes them against each other, and mingles the noise of their chains with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rattle_(percussion_instrument)" property="schema:name">rattle</span> of their bones! Perhaps she is there among them!"</p>
<p>In his state of frenzy, he knew not whither he was going. After a few strides he found himself on the Pont Saint-Michel. There was a light in the window of a ground-floor room; he approached. Through a cracked window he beheld a mean chamber which recalled some confused <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span> to his mind. In that room, badly lighted by a meagre lamp, there was a fresh, light-haired young man, with a merry face, who amid loud bursts of laughter was embracing a very audaciously attired young girl; and near the lamp sat an old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hag" property="schema:name">crone</span> spinning and singing in a quavering voice. As the young man did not laugh constantly, fragments of the old woman's ditty reached the priest; it was something unintelligible yet frightful,—</p></body></html>
