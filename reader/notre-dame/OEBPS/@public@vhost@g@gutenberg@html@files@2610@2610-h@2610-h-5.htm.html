<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  The wall walling <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> makes <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> murmur.<br/></div>
<p>In the fifteenth century, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> was still divided into three wholly distinct and separate towns, each having its own <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physiognomy" property="schema:name">physiognomy</span>, its own specialty, its manners, customs, privileges, and history: the City, the University, the Town. The City, which occupied the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Island" property="schema:name">island</span>, was the most ancient, the smallest, and the mother of the other two, crowded in between them like (may we be pardoned the comparison) a little old woman between two large and handsome maidens. The University covered the left <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank" property="schema:name">bank</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>, from the Tournelle to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tour_de_Nesle" property="schema:name">Tour de Nesle</span>, points which correspond in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> of to-day, the one to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span> market, the other to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mint_(coin)" property="schema:name">mint</span>. Its wall included a large part of that plain where Julian had built his hot baths. The hill of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genevieve" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Sainte-Geneviève</span> was enclosed in it. The culminating point of this sweep of walls was the Papal gate, that is to say, near the present site of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pantheon,_Rome" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Pantheon</span>. The Town, which was the largest of the three fragments of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, held the right <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank" property="schema:name">bank</span>. Its quay, broken or interrupted in many places, ran along the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>, from the Tour de Billy to the Tour du Bois; that is to say, from the place where the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Granary" property="schema:name">granary</span> stands to-day, to the present site of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tuileries_Palace" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Tuileries</span>. These four points, where the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span> intersected the wall of the capital, the Tournelle and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tour_de_Nesle" property="schema:name">Tour de Nesle</span> on the right, the Tour de Billy and the Tour du Bois on the left, were called pre-eminently, "the four towers of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>." The Town encroached still more extensively upon the fields than the University. The culminating point of the Town wall (that of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_V_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles V</span>.) was at the gates of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basilica_of_St_Denis" property="schema:name">Saint-Denis</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laval,_Quebec" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Martin</span>, whose situation has not been changed.</p>
<p>As we have just said, each of these three great divisions of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> was a town, but too special a town to be complete, a city which could not get along without the other two. Hence three entirely distinct aspects: churches abounded in the City; palaces, in the Town; and colleges, in the University. Neglecting here the originalities, of secondary importance in old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, and the capricious regulations regarding the public highways, we will say, from a general point of view, taking only masses and the whole group, in this chaos of communal jurisdictions, that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Island" property="schema:name">island</span> belonged to the bishop, the right <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank" property="schema:name">bank</span> to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span> of the merchants, the left <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank" property="schema:name">bank</span> to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rector_(academia)" property="schema:name">Rector</span>; over all ruled the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, a royal not a municipal official. The City had Notre-Dame; the Town, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Louvre" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Louvre</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hôtel_de_Ville,_Paris" property="schema:name">Hôtel de Ville</span>; the University, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Paris" typeof="schema:EducationalOrganization" property="schema:name">Sorbonne</span>. The Town had the markets (Halles); the city, the Hospital; the University, the Pré-aux-Clercs. Offences committed by the scholars on the left <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank" property="schema:name">bank</span> were tried in the law courts on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Island" property="schema:name">island</span>, and were punished on the right <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank" property="schema:name">bank</span> at Montfauçon; unless the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rector_(academia)" property="schema:name">rector</span>, feeling the university to be strong and the king weak, intervened; for it was the students' privilege to be hanged on their own grounds.</p>
<p>The greater part of these privileges, it may be noted in passing, and there were some even better than the above, had been extorted from the kings by revolts and mutinies. It is the course of things from time immemorial; the king only lets go when the people tear away. There is an old charter which puts the matter naively: apropos of fidelity: <i>Civibus fidelitas in reges, quae tamen aliquoties seditionibus interrypta, multa peperit privileyia</i>.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth century, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span> bathed five islands within the walls of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>: <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louviers" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Louviers</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ait" property="schema:name">island</span>, where there were then trees, and where there is no longer anything but wood; l'ile aux Vaches, and l'ile Notre-Dame, both deserted, with the exception of one house, both <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fee_(feudal_tenure)" property="schema:name">fiefs</span> of the bishop—in the seventeenth century, a single <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ait" property="schema:name">island</span> was formed out of these two, which was built upon and named l'ile <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_IX_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint-Louis</span>—, lastly the City, and at its point, the little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Island" property="schema:name">islet</span> of the cow tender, which was afterwards engulfed beneath the platform of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pont_Neuf" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Pont-Neuf</span>. The City then had five bridges: three on the right, the Pont Notre-Dame, and the Pont au Change, of stone, the Pont aux Meuniers, of wood; two on the left, the Petit Pont, of stone, the Pont Saint-Michel, of wood; all loaded with houses.</p>
<p>The University had six gates, built by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Philip Augustus</span>; there were, beginning with la Tournelle, the Porte Saint-Victor, the Porte Bordelle, the Porte Papale, the Porte Saint-Jacques, the Porte Saint-Michel, the Porte Saint-Germain. The Town had six gates, built by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_V_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles V</span>.; beginning with the Tour de Billy they were: the Porte Saint-Antoine, the Porte du Temple, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Théâtre_de_la_Porte_Saint-Martin" property="schema:name">Porte Saint-Martin</span>, the Porte Saint-Denis, the Porte <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montmartre" property="schema:name">Montmartre</span>, the Porte <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rue_Saint-Honoré" property="schema:name">Saint-Honoré</span>. All these gates were strong, and also handsome, which does not detract from strength. A large, deep <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moat" property="schema:name">moat</span>, with a brisk current during the high water of winter, bathed the base of the wall round <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span> furnished the water. At night, the gates were shut, the river was barred at both ends of the city with huge <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> chains, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> slept tranquilly.</p>
<p>From a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird's-eye_view" property="schema:name">bird's-eye view</span>, these three burgs, the City, the Town, and the University, each presented to the eye an inextricable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hank_(textile)" property="schema:name">skein</span> of eccentrically tangled streets. Nevertheless, at first sight, one recognized the fact that these three fragments formed but one body. One immediately perceived three long parallel streets, unbroken, undisturbed, traversing, almost in a straight line, all three cities, from one end to the other; from North to South, perpendicularly, to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>, which bound them together, mingled them, infused them in each other, poured and transfused the people incessantly, from one to the other, and made one out of the three. The first of these streets ran from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Théâtre_de_la_Porte_Saint-Martin" property="schema:name">Porte Saint-Martin</span>: it was called the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rue_Saint-Jacques,_Paris" property="schema:name">Rue Saint-Jacques</span> in the University, Rue de la Juiverie in the City, Rue Saint-Martin in the Town; it crossed the water twice, under the name of the Petit Pont and the Pont Notre-Dame. The second, which was called the Rue de la Harpe on the left <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank" property="schema:name">bank</span>, Rue de la Barillerié in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Island" property="schema:name">island</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Denis_Street" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Rue Saint-Denis</span> on the right <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank" property="schema:name">bank</span>, Pont Saint-Michel on one arm of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>, Pont au Change on the other, ran from the Porte Saint-Michel in the University, to the Porte Saint-Denis in the Town. However, under all these names, there were but two streets, parent streets, generating streets,—the two arteries of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. All the other <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vein" property="schema:name">veins</span> of the triple city either derived their supply from them or emptied into them.</p>
<p>Independently of these two principal streets, piercing <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> diametrically in its whole breadth, from side to side, common to the entire capital, the City and the University had also each its own great special street, which ran lengthwise by them, parallel to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>, cutting, as it passed, at right angles, the two <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arterial_road" property="schema:name">arterial thoroughfares</span>. Thus, in the Town, one descended in a straight line from the Porte Saint-Antoine to the Porte <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rue_Saint-Honoré" property="schema:name">Saint-Honoré</span>; in the University from the Porte Saint-Victor to the Porte Saint-Germain. These two great thoroughfares intersected by the two first, formed the canvas upon which reposed, knotted and crowded together on every hand, the labyrinthine network of the streets of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. In the incomprehensible plan of these streets, one distinguished likewise, on looking attentively, two clusters of great streets, like magnified <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pulley" property="schema:name">sheaves</span> of grain, one in the University, the other in the Town, which spread out gradually from the bridges to the gates.</p>
<p>Some traces of this geometrical plan still exist to-day.</p>
<p>Now, what aspect did this whole present, when, as viewed from the summit of the towers of Notre-Dame, in 1482? That we shall try to describe.</p>
<p>For the spectator who arrived, panting, upon that pinnacle, it was first a dazzling confusing view of roofs, chimneys, streets, bridges, places, spires, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell towers</span>. Everything struck your eye at once: the carved <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gable" property="schema:name">gable</span>, the pointed roof, the turrets suspended at the angles of the walls; the stone <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyramid" property="schema:name">pyramids</span> of the eleventh century, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slate" property="schema:name">slate</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Obelisk" property="schema:name">obelisks</span> of the fifteenth; the round, bare tower of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keep" property="schema:name">donjon</span> keep; the square and fretted tower of the church; the great and the little, the massive and the aerial. The eye was, for a long time, wholly lost in this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labyrinth" property="schema:name">labyrinth</span>, where there was nothing which did not possess its originality, its reason, its genius, its beauty,—nothing which did not proceed from art; beginning with the smallest house, with its painted and carved front, with external beams, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ellipse" property="schema:name">elliptical</span> door, with projecting stories, to the royal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Louvre" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Louvre</span>, which then had a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Column" property="schema:name">colonnade</span> of towers. But these are the principal masses which were then to be distinguished when the eye began to accustom itself to this tumult of edifices.</p>
<p>In the first place, the City.—"The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Island" property="schema:name">island</span> of the City," as Sauval says, who, in spite of his confused medley, sometimes has such happy turns of expression,—"the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Island" property="schema:name">island</span> of the city is made like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rating_system_of_the_Royal_Navy" property="schema:name">great ship</span>, stuck in the mud and run aground in the current, near the centre of the Seine."</p>
<p>We have just explained that, in the fifteenth century, this ship was anchored to the two banks of the river by five bridges. This form of a ship had also struck the heraldic scribes; for it is from that, and not from the siege by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Normans" property="schema:name">Normans</span>, that the ship which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blazon" property="schema:name">blazons</span> the old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Escutcheon_(heraldry)" property="schema:name">shield</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, comes, according to Favyn and Pasquier. For him who understands how to decipher them, armorial bearings are algebra, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coat_of_arms" property="schema:name">armorial bearings</span> have a tongue. The whole history of the second half of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span> is written in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coat_of_arms" property="schema:name">armorial bearings</span>,—the first half is in the symbolism of the Roman churches. They are the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egyptian_hieroglyphs" property="schema:name">hieroglyphics</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feudalism" property="schema:name">feudalism</span>, succeeding those of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theocracy" property="schema:name">theocracy</span>.</p>
<p>Thus the City first presented itself to the eye, with its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stern" property="schema:name">stern</span> to the east, and its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prow" property="schema:name">prow</span> to the west. Turning towards the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prow" property="schema:name">prow</span>, one had before one an innumerable flock of ancient roofs, over which arched broadly the lead-covered <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apse" property="schema:name">apse</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sainte-Chapelle" property="schema:name">Sainte-Chapelle</span>, like an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elephant" property="schema:name">elephant</span>'s haunches loaded with its tower. Only here, this tower was the most audacious, the most open, the most ornamented <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span> of cabinet-maker's work that ever let the sky peep through its cone of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lace" property="schema:name">lace</span>. In front of Notre-Dame, and very near at hand, three streets opened into the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow_Cathedral" property="schema:name">cathedral square</span>,—a fine square, lined with ancient houses. Over the south side of this place bent the wrinkled and sullen façade of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" property="schema:name">Hôtel Dieu</span>, and its roof, which seemed covered with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wart" property="schema:name">warts</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cutaneous_condition" property="schema:name">pustules</span>. Then, on the right and the left, to east and west, within that wall of the City, which was yet so contracted, rose the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell towers</span> of its one and twenty churches, of every date, of every form, of every size, from the low and wormeaten <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">belfry</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basilica_of_St_Denis" property="schema:name">Saint-Denis</span> du Pas (<i>Carcer Glaueini</i>) to the slender needles of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Pierre_and_Miquelon" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Saint-Pierre</span> aux Boeufs and Saint-Landry.</p>
<p>Behind Notre-Dame, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span> and its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> galleries spread out towards the north; on the south, the half-Roman <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace" property="schema:name">palace</span> of the bishop; on the east, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Desert" property="schema:name">desert</span> point of the Terrain. In this throng of houses the eye also distinguished, by the lofty open-work <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mitre" property="schema:name">mitres</span> of stone which then crowned the roof itself, even the most elevated windows of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace" property="schema:name">palace</span>, the Hôtel given by the city, under <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_VI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles VI</span>., to Juvénal des Ursins; a little farther on, the pitch-covered sheds of the Palus Market; in still another quarter the new <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apse" property="schema:name">apse</span> of Saint-Germain le Vieux, lengthened in 1458, with a bit of the Rue aux Febves; and then, in places, a square crowded with people; a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>, erected at the corner of a street; a fine fragment of the pavement of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Philip Augustus</span>, a magnificent flagging, grooved for the horses' feet, in the middle of the road, and so badly replaced in the sixteenth century by the miserable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cobblestone" property="schema:name">cobblestones</span>, called the "pavement of the League;" a deserted back courtyard, with one of those diaphanous staircase turrets, such as were erected in the fifteenth century, one of which is still to be seen in the Rue des Bourdonnais. Lastly, at the right of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sainte-Chapelle" property="schema:name">Sainte-Chapelle</span>, towards the west, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pala_Empire" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Pala</span>is de Justice rested its group of towers at the edge of the water. The thickets of the king's gardens, which covered the western point of the City, masked the Island du Passeur. As for the water, from the summit of the towers of Notre-Dame one hardly saw it, on either side of the City; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span> was hidden by bridges, the bridges by houses.</p>
<p>And when the glance passed these bridges, whose roofs were visibly green, rendered mouldy before their time by the vapors from the water, if it was directed to the left, towards the University, the first edifice which struck it was a large, low <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sheaf_(mathematics)" property="schema:name">sheaf</span> of towers, the Petit-Chàtelet, whose yawning gate devoured the end of the Petit-Pont. Then, if your view ran along the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank" property="schema:name">bank</span>, from east to west, from the Tournelle to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tour_de_Nesle" property="schema:name">Tour de Nesle</span>, there was a long cordon of houses, with carved beams, stained-glass windows, each story projecting over that beneath it, an interminable zigzag of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gable" property="schema:name">gables</span>, frequently interrupted by the mouth of a street, and from time to time also by the front or angle of a huge stone mansion, planted at its ease, with courts and gardens, wings and detached buildings, amid this populace of crowded and narrow houses, like a grand gentleman among a throng of rustics. There were five or six of these mansions on the quay, from the house of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorraine_(region)" typeof="schema:AdministrativeArea" property="schema:name">Lorraine</span>, which shared with the Bernardins the grand enclosure adjoining the Tournelle, to the Hôtel de Nesle, whose principal tower ended <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, and whose pointed roofs were in a position, during three months of the year, to encroach, with their black triangles, upon the scarlet disk of the setting sun.</p>
<p>This side of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span> was, however, the least mercantile of the two. Students furnished more of a crowd and more noise there than artisans, and there was not, properly speaking, any quay, except from the Pont Saint-Michel to the Tour de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nesle" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Nesle</span>. The rest of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank_(geography)" property="schema:name">bank</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span> was now a naked strand, the same as beyond the Bernardins; again, a throng of houses, standing with their feet in the water, as between the two bridges.</p>
<p>There was a great uproar of laundresses; they screamed, and talked, and sang from morning till night along the beach, and beat a great deal of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linen" property="schema:name">linen</span> there, just as in our day. This is not the least of the gayeties of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>.</p>
<p>The University presented a dense mass to the eye. From one end to the other, it was homogeneous and compact. The thousand roofs, dense, angular, clinging to each other, composed, nearly all, of the same geometrical element, offered, when viewed from above, the aspect of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crystal" property="schema:name">crystallization</span> of the same substance.</p>
<p>The capricious ravine of streets did not cut this block of houses into too disproportionate slices. The forty-two colleges were scattered about in a fairly equal manner, and there were some everywhere. The amusingly varied crests of these beautiful edifices were the product of the same art as the simple roofs which they overshot, and were, actually, only a multiplication of the square or the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sphere" property="schema:name">cube</span> of the same geometrical figure. Hence they complicated the whole effect, without disturbing it; completed, without overloading it. Geometry is harmony. Some fine mansions here and there made magnificent outlines against the picturesque attics of the left <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank" property="schema:name">bank</span>. The house of Nevers, the house of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Rome</span>, the house of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reims" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Reims</span>, which have disappeared; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musée_national_du_Moyen_Âge" property="schema:name">Hôtel de Cluny</span>, which still exists, for the consolation of the artist, and whose tower was so stupidly deprived of its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span> a few years ago. Close to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cluny_Abbey" property="schema:name">Cluny</span>, that Roman <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace" property="schema:name">palace</span>, with fine round arches, were once the hot baths of Julian. There were a great many abbeys, of a beauty more devout, of a grandeur more solemn than the mansions, but not less beautiful, not less grand. Those which first caught the eye were the Bernardins, with their three <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell towers</span>; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Panthéon,_Paris" property="schema:name">Sainte-Geneviève</span>, whose square tower, which still exists, makes us regret the rest; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Paris" typeof="schema:EducationalOrganization" property="schema:name">Sorbonne</span>, half college, half monastery, of which so admirable a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nave" property="schema:name">nave</span> survives; the fine <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quadrilateral" property="schema:name">quadrilateral</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span> of the Mathurins; its neighbor, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span> of Saint-Benoit, within whose walls they have had time to cobble up a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theatre" property="schema:name">theatre</span>, between the seventh and eighth editions of this book; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cordeliers" property="schema:name">Cordeliers</span>, with their three enormous adjacent <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gable" property="schema:name">gables</span>; the Augustins, whose graceful <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span> formed, after the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tour_de_Nesle" property="schema:name">Tour de Nesle</span>, the second denticulation on this side of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, starting from the west. The colleges, which are, in fact, the intermediate ring between the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span> and the world, hold the middle position in the monumental series between the Hôtels and the abbeys, with a severity full of elegance, sculpture less giddy than the palaces, an architecture less severe than the convents. Unfortunately, hardly anything remains of these monuments, where <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic art</span> combined with so just a balance, richness and economy. The churches (and they were numerous and splendid in the University, and they were graded there also in all the ages of architecture, from the round arches of Saint-Julian to the pointed arches of Saint-Séverin), the churches dominated the whole; and, like one harmony more in this mass of harmonies, they pierced in quick succession the multiple open work of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gable" property="schema:name">gables</span> with slashed spires, with open-work <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell towers</span>, with slender <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pinnacle" property="schema:name">pinnacles</span>, whose line was also only a magnificent exaggeration of the acute angle of the roofs.</p>
<p>The ground of the University was hilly; Mount <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Panthéon,_Paris" property="schema:name">Sainte-Geneviève</span> formed an enormous mound to the south; and it was a sight to see from the summit of Notre-Dame how that throng of narrow and tortuous streets (to-day the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span> Quarter), those bunches of houses which, spread out in every direction from the top of this eminence, precipitated themselves in disorder, and almost perpendicularly down its flanks, nearly to the water's edge, having the air, some of falling, others of clambering up again, and all of holding to one another. A continual flux of a thousand black points which passed each other on the pavements made everything move before the eyes; it was the populace seen thus from aloft and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afar_people" property="schema:name">afar</span>.</p>
<p>Lastly, in the intervals of these roofs, of these spires, of these accidents of numberless edifices, which bent and writhed, and jagged in so eccentric a manner the extreme line of the University, one caught a glimpse, here and there, of a great expanse of moss-grown wall, a thick, round tower, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battlement" property="schema:name">crenellated</span> city gate, shadowing forth the fortress; it was the wall of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Philip Augustus</span>. Beyond, the fields gleamed green; beyond, fled the roads, along which were scattered a few more suburban houses, which became more infrequent as they became more distant. Some of these <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Faubourg" property="schema:name">faubourgs</span> were important: there were, first, starting from la Tournelle, the Bourg Saint-Victor, with its one <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arch_bridge" property="schema:name">arch bridge</span> over the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bièvre_(river)" property="schema:name">Bièvre</span>, its abbey where one could read the epitaph of Louis le Gros, <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epitaph" property="schema:name">epitaph</span>ium Ludovici Grossi</i>, and its church with an octagonal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span>, flanked with four little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell towers</span> of the eleventh century (a similar one can be seen at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Étampes" property="schema:name">Etampes</span>; it is not yet destroyed); next, the Bourg Saint-Marceau, which already had three churches and one convent; then, leaving the mill of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gobelin" property="schema:name">Gobelins</span> and its four white walls on the left, there was the Faubourg Saint-Jacques with the beautiful carved cross in its square; the church of Saint-Jacques du Haut-Pas, which was then <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span>, pointed, charming; Saint-Magloire, a fine <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nave" property="schema:name">nave</span> of the fourteenth century, which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Napoleon</span> turned into a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loft" property="schema:name">hayloft</span>; Notre-Dame des Champs, where there were <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantine_architecture" property="schema:name">Byzantine</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mosaic" property="schema:name">mosaics</span>; lastly, after having left behind, full in the country, the Monas<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Transport_express_régional" property="schema:name">ter</span>y des Chartreux, a rich edifice contemporary with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law_Courts_of_Brussels" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Palais de Justice</span>, with its little garden divided into compartments, and the haunted ruins of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vauvert" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Vauvert</span>, the eye fell, to the west, upon the three Roman spires of Saint-Germain des Prés. The Bourg Saint-Germain, already a large community, formed fifteen or twenty streets in the rear; the pointed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell tower</span> of Saint-Sulpice marked one corner of the town. Close beside it one descried the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quadrilateral" property="schema:name">quadrilateral</span> enclosure of the fair of Saint-Germain, where the market is situated to-day; then the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abbot" property="schema:name">abbot</span>'s <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>, a pretty little round tower, well capped with a leaden cone; the brickyard was further on, and the Rue du Four, which led to the common bakehouse, and the mill on its hillock, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leper_colony" property="schema:name">lazar house</span>, a tiny house, isolated and half seen.</p>
<p>But that which attracted the eye most of all, and fixed it for a long time on that point, was the abbey itself. It is certain that this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monastery" property="schema:name">monastery</span>, which had a grand air, both as a church and as a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manorialism" property="schema:name">seignory</span>; that abbatial <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace" property="schema:name">palace</span>, where the bishops of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> counted themselves happy if they could pass the night; that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Refectory" property="schema:name">refectory</span>, upon which the architect had bestowed the air, the beauty, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rose_window" property="schema:name">rose window</span> of a cathedral; that elegant chapel of the Virgin; that monumental dormitory; those vast gardens; that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portcullis" property="schema:name">portcullis</span>; that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drawbridge" property="schema:name">drawbridge</span>; that envelope of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battlement" property="schema:name">battlements</span> which notched to the eye the verdure of the surrounding <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Meadow" property="schema:name">meadows</span>; those courtyards, where gleamed men at arms, intermingled with golden copes;—the whole grouped and clustered about three lofty spires, with round arches, well planted upon a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apse" property="schema:name">apse</span>, made a magnificent figure against the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Observable_universe" property="schema:name">horizon</span>.</p>
<p>When, at length, after having contemplated the University for a long time, you turned towards the right <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flight_dynamics_(fixed-wing_aircraft)" property="schema:name">bank</span>, towards the Town, the character of the spectacle was abruptly altered. The Town, in fact much larger than the University, was also less of a unit. At the first glance, one saw that it was divided into many masses, singularly distinct. First, to the eastward, in that part of the town which still takes its name from the marsh where Camulogènes entangled <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julius_Caesar" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Caesar</span>, was a pile of palaces. The block extended to the very water's edge. Four almost contiguous Hôtels, Jouy, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sens" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Sens</span>, Barbeau, the house of the Queen, mirrored their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slate" property="schema:name">slate</span> peaks, broken with slender turrets, in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>.</p>
<p>These four edifices filled the space from the Rue des Nonaindières, to the abbey of the Celestins, whose <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span> gracefully relieved their line of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gable" property="schema:name">gables</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battlement" property="schema:name">battlements</span>. A few miserable, greenish hovels, hanging over the water in front of these sumptuous Hôtels, did not prevent one from seeing the fine angles of their façades, their large, square windows with stone <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mullion" property="schema:name">mullions</span>, their pointed porches overloaded with statues, the vivid outlines of their walls, always clear cut, and all those charming accidents of architecture, which cause <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic art</span> to have the air of beginning its combinations afresh with every monument.</p>
<p>Behind these palaces, extended in all directions, now broken, fenced in, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battlement" property="schema:name">battlemented</span> like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Citadel" property="schema:name">citadel</span>, now veiled by great trees like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carthusian" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">Carthusian</span> convent, the immense and multiform enclosure of that miraculous Hôtel de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Pol</span>, where the King of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span> possessed the means of lodging superbly two and twenty princes of the rank of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dauphin_of_France" property="schema:name">dauphin</span> and the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duke_of_Burgundy" property="schema:name">Burgundy</span>, with their domestics and their suites, without counting the great lords, and the emperor when he came to view <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, and the lions, who had their separate Hôtel at the royal Hôtel. Let us say here that a prince's apartment was then composed of never less than eleven large rooms, from the chamber of state to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oratory_(worship)" property="schema:name">oratory</span>, not to mention the galleries, baths, vapor-baths, and other "superfluous places," with which each apartment was provided; not to mention the private gardens for each of the king's guests; not to mention the kitchens, the cellars, the domestic offices, the general refectories of the house, the poultry-yards, where there were twenty-two general laboratories, from the bakehouses to the wine-cellars; games of a thousand sorts, malls, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Real_tennis" property="schema:name">tennis</span>, and riding at the ring; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aviary" property="schema:name">aviaries</span>, fishponds, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Menagerie" property="schema:name">menageries</span>, stables, barns, libraries, arsenals and foundries. This was what a king's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace_of_Versailles" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">palace</span>, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louvre_Palace" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Louvre</span>, a Hôtel de Saint-Pol was then. A city within a city.</p>
<p>From the tower where we are placed, the Hôtel <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Pol</span>, almost half hidden by the four great houses of which we have just spoken, was still very considerable and very marvellous to see. One could there distinguish, very well, though cleverly united with the principal building by long galleries, decked with painted glass and slender columns, the three Hôtels which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_V_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles V</span>. had amalgamated with his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace" property="schema:name">palace</span>: the Hôtel du Petit-Muce, with the airy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span>, which formed a graceful border to its roof; the Hôtel of the Abbe de Saint-Maur, having the vanity of a stronghold, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keep" property="schema:name">great tower</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Machicolation" property="schema:name">machicolations</span>, loopholes, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cast_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> gratings, and over the large <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anglo-Saxons" property="schema:name">Saxon</span> door, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coat_of_arms" property="schema:name">armorial bearings</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abbot" property="schema:name">abbé</span>, between the two mortises of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drawbridge" property="schema:name">drawbridge</span>; the Hôtel of the Comte d' <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Étampes" property="schema:name">Etampes</span>, whose <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keep" property="schema:name">donjon</span> keep, ruined at its summit, was rounded and notched like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rooster" property="schema:name">cock</span>'s <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Honeycomb" property="schema:name">comb</span>; here and there, three or four ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oak" property="schema:name">oaks</span>, forming a tuft together like enormous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cauliflower" property="schema:name">cauliflowers</span>; gambols of swans, in the clear water of the fishponds, all in folds of light and shade; many courtyards of which one beheld picturesque bits; the Hôtel of the Lions, with its low, pointed arches on short, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anglo-Saxons" property="schema:name">Saxon</span> pillars, its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cast_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> gratings and its perpetual roar; shooting up above the whole, the scale-ornamented <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span> of the Ave-Maria; on the left, the house of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">Provost</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, flanked by four small towers, delicately grooved, in the middle; at the extremity, the Hôtel Saint-Pol, properly speaking, with its multiplied façades, its successive enrichments from the time of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_V_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles V</span>., the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hybrid_(biology)" property="schema:name">hybrid</span> excrescences, with which the fancy of the architects had loaded it during the last two centuries, with all the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apse" property="schema:name">apses</span> of its chapels, all the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gable" property="schema:name">gables</span> of its galleries, a thousand <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Weather_vane" property="schema:name">weathercocks</span> for the four winds, and its two lofty contiguous towers, whose conical roof, surrounded by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battlement" property="schema:name">battlements</span> at its base, looked like those pointed caps which have their edges turned up.</p>
<p>Continuing to mount the stories of this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphitheatre" property="schema:name">amphitheatre</span> of palaces spread out <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afar_people" property="schema:name">afar</span> upon the ground, after crossing a deep ravine hollowed out of the roofs in the Town, which marked the passage of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Antoine_Street" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Rue Saint-Antoine</span>, the eye reached the house of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angoulême" property="schema:name">Angoulême</span>, a vast construction of many epochs, where there were perfectly new and very white parts, which melted no better into the whole than a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> patch on a blue <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doublet_(clothing)" property="schema:name">doublet</span>. Nevertheless, the remarkably pointed and lofty roof of the modern <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace" property="schema:name">palace</span>, bristling with carved <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eaves" property="schema:name">eaves</span>, covered with sheets of lead, where coiled a thousand fantastic <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabesque_(Islamic_art)" property="schema:name">arabesques</span> of sparkling incrustations of gilded bronze, that roof, so curiously damascened, darted upwards gracefully from the midst of the brown ruins of the ancient edifice; whose huge and ancient towers, rounded by age like casks, sinking together with old age, and rending themselves from top to bottom, resembled great bellies unbuttoned. Behind rose the forest of spires of the Palais des Tournelles. Not a view in the world, either at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Château_de_Chambord" property="schema:name">Chambord</span> or at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alhambra" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Alhambra</span>, is more <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span>, more aerial, more enchanting, than that thicket of spires, tiny <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell towers</span>, chimneys, weather-vanes, winding staircases, lan<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tern" property="schema:name">terns</span> through which the daylight makes its way, which seem cut out at a blow, pavilions, spindle-shaped turrets, or, as they were then called, "tournelles," all differing in form, in height, and attitude. One would have pronounced it a gigantic stone chess-board.</p>
<p>To the right of the Tournelles, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Truss" property="schema:name">truss</span> of enormous towers, black as ink, running into each other and tied, as it were, by a circular <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moat" property="schema:name">moat</span>; that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keep" property="schema:name">donjon</span> keep, much more pierced with loopholes than with windows; that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drawbridge" property="schema:name">drawbridge</span>, always raised; that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portcullis" property="schema:name">portcullis</span>, always lowered,—is the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution" property="schema:name">Bastille</span>. Those sorts of black beaks which project from between the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battlement" property="schema:name">battlements</span>, and which you take from a distance to be cave spouts, are cannons.</p>
<p>Beneath them, at the foot of the formidable edifice, behold the Porte Sainte-Antoine, buried between its two towers.</p>
<p>Beyond the Tournelles, as far as the wall of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_V_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles V</span>., spread out, with rich compartments of verdure and of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flower" property="schema:name">flowers</span>, a velvet carpet of cultivated land and royal parks, in the midst of which one recognized, by its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labyrinth" property="schema:name">labyrinth</span> of trees and alleys, the famous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daedalus" property="schema:name">Daedalus</span> garden which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. had given to Coictier. The doctor's observatory rose above the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labyrinth" property="schema:name">labyrinth</span> like a great isolated column, with a tiny house for a capital. Terrible astrologies took place in that laboratory.</p>
<p>There to-day is the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Place_des_Vosges" property="schema:name">Place Royale</span>.</p>
<p>As we have just said, the quarter of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace" property="schema:name">palace</span>, of which we have just endeavored to give the reader some idea by indicating only the chief points, filled the angle which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles V</span>.'s wall made with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span> on the east. The centre of the Town was occupied by a pile of houses for the populace. It was there, in fact, that the three bridges disgorged upon the right <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank_(geography)" property="schema:name">bank</span>, and bridges lead to the building of houses rather than palaces. That congregation of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> habitations, pressed together like the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cell_(biology)" property="schema:name">cells</span> in a hive, had a beauty of its own. It is with the roofs of a capital as with the waves of the sea,—they are grand. First the streets, crossed and entangled, forming a hundred amusing figures in the block; around the market-place, it was like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Star" property="schema:name">star</span> with a thousand rays.</p>
<p>The Rues <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basilica_of_St_Denis" property="schema:name">Saint-Denis</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laval,_Quebec" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Martin</span>, with their innumerable ramifications, rose one after the other, like trees intertwining their branches; and then the tortuous lines, the Rues de la Plâtrerie, de la Verrerie, de la Tixeranderie, etc., meandered over all. There were also fine edifices which pierced the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petrifaction" property="schema:name">petrified</span> undulations of that sea of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gable" property="schema:name">gables</span>. At the head of the Pont aux Changeurs, behind which one beheld the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span> foaming beneath the wheels of the Pont aux Meuniers, there was the Chalelet, no longer a Roman tower, as under Julian the Apostate, but a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feudalism" property="schema:name">feudal</span> tower of the thirteenth century, and of a stone so hard that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pickaxe" property="schema:name">pickaxe</span> could not break away so much as the thickness of the fist in a space of three hours; there was the rich square <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell tower</span> of Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie, with its angles all frothing with carvings, already admirable, although it was not finished in the fifteenth century. (It lacked, in particular, the four monsters, which, still perched to-day on the corners of its roof, have the air of so many <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sphinx" property="schema:name">sphinxes</span> who are propounding to new <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> the riddle of the ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. Rault, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sculpture" property="schema:name">sculptor</span>, only placed them in position in 1526, and received twenty francs for his pains.) There was the Maison-aux-Piliers, the Pillar House, opening upon that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Place_de_l'Hôtel-de-Ville" property="schema:name">Place de Grève</span> of which we have given the reader some idea; there was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/St-Gervais-et-St-Protais" property="schema:name">Saint-Gervais</span>, which a front "in good taste" has since spoiled; Saint-Méry, whose ancient pointed arches were still almost round arches; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Jean</span>, whose magnificent <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span> was proverbial; there were twenty other monuments, which did not disdain to bury their wonders in that chaos of black, deep, narrow streets. Add the crosses of carved stone, more lavishly scattered through the squares than even the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbets</span>; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cemetery" property="schema:name">cemetery</span> of the Innocents, whose architectural wall could be seen in the distance above the roofs; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span> of the Markets, whose top was visible between two chimneys of the Rue de la Cossonnerie; the ladder of the Croix-du-Trahoir, in its square always black with people; the circular buildings of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wheat" property="schema:name">wheat</span> mart; the fragments of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Philip Augustus</span>'s ancient wall, which could be made out here and there, drowned among the houses, its towers gnawed by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ivy" property="schema:name">ivy</span>, its gates in ruins, with crumbling and deformed stretches of wall; the quay with its thousand shops, and its bloody <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Knacker" property="schema:name">knacker</span>'s yards; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span> encumbered with boats, from the Port au Foin to Port-l'Evêque, and you will have a confused picture of what the central <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trapezoid" property="schema:name">trapezium</span> of the Town was like in 1482.</p>
<p>With these two quarters, one of Hôtels, the other of houses, the third feature of aspect presented by the city was a long zone of abbeys, which bordered it in nearly the whole of its circumference, from the rising to the setting sun, and, behind the circle of fortifications which hemmed in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, formed a second interior enclosure of convents and chapels. Thus, immediately adjoining the park des Tournelles, between the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Antoine_Street" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Rue Saint-Antoine</span> and the Vielle Rue du Temple, there stood Sainte-Catherine, with its immense cultivated lands, which were terminated only by the wall of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. Between the old and the new Rue du Temple, there was the Temple, a sinister group of towers, lofty, erect, and isolated in the middle of a vast, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battlement" property="schema:name">battlemented</span> enclosure. Between the Rue Neuve-du-Temple and the Rue Saint-Martin, there was the Abbey of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laval,_Quebec" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Martin</span>, in the midst of its gardens, a superb <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fortified_church" property="schema:name">fortified church</span>, whose girdle of towers, whose <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diadem" property="schema:name">diadem</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell towers</span>, yielded in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span> and splendor only to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Germain-des-Prés" property="schema:name">Saint-Germain des Prés</span>. Between the Rue Saint-Martin and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Denis_Street" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Rue Saint-Denis</span>, spread the enclosure of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sainte-Trinité,_Paris" property="schema:name">Trinité</span>.</p>
<p>Lastly, between the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Denis_Street" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Rue Saint-Denis</span>, and the Rue Montorgueil, stood the Filles-Dieu. On one side, the rotting roofs and unpaved enclosure of the Cour des Miracles could be descried. It was the sole profane ring which was linked to that devout chain of convents.</p>
<p>Finally, the fourth compartment, which stretched itself out in the agglomeration of the roofs on the right bank, and which occupied the western angle of the enclosure, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank" property="schema:name">bank</span>s of the river down stream, was a fresh cluster of palaces and Hôtels pressed close about the base of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Louvre" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Louvre</span>. The old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Louvre" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Louvre</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Philip Augustus</span>, that immense edifice whose <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keep" property="schema:name">great tower</span> rallied about it three and twenty chief towers, not to reckon the lesser towers, seemed from a distance to be enshrined in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> roofs of the Hôtel d'Alençon, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hôtel_du_Petit-Bourbon" property="schema:name">Petit-Bourbon</span>. This <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lernaean_Hydra" property="schema:name">hydra</span> of towers, giant guardian of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, with its four and twenty heads, always erect, with its monstrous haunches, loaded or scaled with slates, and all streaming with metallic reflections, terminated with wonderful effect the configuration of the Town towards the west.</p>
<p>Thus an immense block, which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome" property="schema:name">Romans</span> called <i>iusula</i>, or <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Island" property="schema:name">island</span>, of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> houses, flanked on the right and the left by two blocks of palaces, crowned, the one by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Louvre" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Louvre</span>, the other by the Tournelles, bordered on the north by a long girdle of abbeys and cultivated enclosures, all amalgamated and melted together in one view; upon these thousands of edifices, whose tiled and slated roofs outlined upon each other so many fantastic chains, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell towers</span>, tattooed, fluted, and ornamented with twisted bands, of the four and forty churches on the right <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank" property="schema:name">bank</span>; myriads of cross streets; for boundary on one side, an enclosure of lofty walls with square towers (that of the University had round towers); on the other, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>, cut by bridges, and bearing on its bosom a multitude of boats; behold the Town of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> in the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>Beyond the walls, several suburban villages pressed close about the gates, but less numerous and more scattered than those of the University. Behind the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution" property="schema:name">Bastille</span> there were twenty hovels clustered round the curious sculptures of the Croix-Faubin and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flying_buttress" property="schema:name">flying buttresses</span> of the Abbey of Saint-Antoine des Champs; then Popincourt, lost amid <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wheat" property="schema:name">wheat</span> fields; then la Courtille, a merry <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Civil_parishes_in_England" property="schema:name">village</span> of wine-shops; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hamlet_(place)" property="schema:name">hamlet</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Laurent,_Quebec" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Laurent</span> with its church whose <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell tower</span>, from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afar_people" property="schema:name">afar</span>, seemed to add itself to the pointed towers of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Théâtre_de_la_Porte_Saint-Martin" property="schema:name">Porte Saint-Martin</span>; the Faubourg <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basilica_of_St_Denis" property="schema:name">Saint-Denis</span>, with the vast enclosure of Saint-Ladre; beyond the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montmartre" property="schema:name">Montmartre</span> Gate, the Grange-Batelière, encircled with white walls; behind it, with its chalky slopes, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montmartre" property="schema:name">Montmartre</span>, which had then almost as many churches as <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Windmill" property="schema:name">windmills</span>, and which has kept only the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Windmill" property="schema:name">windmills</span>, for society no longer demands anything but bread for the body. Lastly, beyond the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Louvre" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Louvre</span>, the Faubourg <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rue_Saint-Honoré" property="schema:name">Saint-Honoré</span>, already considerable at that time, could be seen stretching away into the fields, and Petit-Bretagne gleaming green, and the Marché aux Pourceaux spreading abroad, in whose centre swelled the horrible apparatus used for boiling counterfeiters. Between la Courtille and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Laurent,_Quebec" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Laurent</span>, your eye had already noticed, on the summit of an eminence crouching amid <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Desert" property="schema:name">desert</span> plains, a sort of edifice which resembled from a distance a ruined <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonnade" property="schema:name">colonnade</span>, mounted upon a basement with its foundation laid bare. This was neither a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parthenon" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Parthenon</span>, nor a temple of the Olympian <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>. It was Montfauçon.</p>
<p>Now, if the enumeration of so many edifices, summary as we have endeavored to make it, has not shattered in the reader's mind the general image of old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, as we have constructed it, we will recapitulate it in a few words. In the centre, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Island" property="schema:name">island</span> of the City, resembling as to form an enormous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tortoise" property="schema:name">tortoise</span>, and throwing out its bridges with tiles for scales; like legs from beneath its gray shell of roofs. On the left, the monolithic <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trapezoid" property="schema:name">trapezium</span>, firm, dense, bristling, of the University; on the right, the vast semicircle of the Town, much more intermixed with gardens and monuments. The three blocks, city, university, and town, marbled with innumerable streets. Across all, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>, "foster-mother <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>," as says Father Du Breul, blocked with islands, bridges, and boats. All about an immense plain, patched with a thousand sorts of cultivated plots, sown with fine villages. On the left, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Issy-les-Moulineaux" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Issy</span>, Vanvres, Vaugirarde, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montrouge" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Montrouge</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gentilly,_New_Orleans" property="schema:name">Gentilly</span>, with its round tower and its square tower, etc.; on the right, twenty others, from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Albertville" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Conflans</span> to Ville-l'Evêque. On the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soil_horizon" property="schema:name">horizon</span>, a border of hills arranged in a circle like the rim of the basin. Finally, far away to the east, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vincennes" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Vincennes</span>, and its seven quadrangular towers to the south, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Le_Kremlin-Bicêtre" property="schema:name">Bicêtre</span> and its pointed turrets; to the north, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basilica_of_St_Denis" property="schema:name">Saint-Denis</span> and its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span>; to the west, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Cloud" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint Cloud</span> and its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keep" property="schema:name">donjon</span> keep. Such was the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raven" property="schema:name">ravens</span>, who lived in 1482, beheld from the summits of the towers of Notre-Dame.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voltaire" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Voltaire</span> said of this city, that "before <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XIV</span>., it possessed but four fine monuments": the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dome" property="schema:name">dome</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sorbonne_(building)" property="schema:name">Sorbonne</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Val-de-Grâce" property="schema:name">Val-de-Grâce</span>, the modern <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Louvre" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Louvre</span>, and I know not what the fourth was—the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luxembourg" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Luxembourg</span>, perhaps. Fortunately, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voltaire" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Voltaire</span> was the author of "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Candide" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">Candide</span>" in spite of this, and in spite of this, he is, among all the men who have followed each other in the long series of humanity, the one who has best possessed the diabolical laugh. Moreover, this proves that one can be a fine genius, and yet understand nothing of an art to which one does not belong. Did not <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Molière" property="schema:name">Moliere</span> imagine that he was doing <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raphael" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Raphael</span> and Michael-Angelo a very great honor, by calling them "those Mignards of their age?"</p>
<p>Let us return to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> and to the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>It was not then merely a handsome city; it was a homogeneous city, an architectural and historical product of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span>, a chronicle in stone. It was a city formed of two layers only; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque</span> layer and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> layer; for the Roman layer had disappeared long before, with the exception of the Hot Baths of Julian, where it still pierced through the thick <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crust_(geology)" property="schema:name">crust</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span>. As for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celts" property="schema:name">Celtic</span> layer, no specimens were any longer to be found, even when sinking wells.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, when the Renaissance began to mingle with this unity which was so severe and yet so varied, the dazzling luxury of its fantasies and systems, its debasements of Roman round arches, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece" property="schema:name">Greek</span> columns, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> bases, its sculpture which was so tender and so ideal, its peculiar taste for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabesque_(Islamic_art)" property="schema:name">arabesques</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acanthus_(ornament)" property="schema:name">acanthus</span> leaves, its architectural <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germanic_paganism" property="schema:name">paganism</span>, contemporary with Luther, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, was perhaps, still more beautiful, although less harmonious to the eye, and to the thought.</p>
<p>But this splendid moment lasted only for a short time; the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance_architecture" property="schema:name">Renaissance</span> was not impartial; it did not content itself with building, it wished to destroy; it is true that it required the room. Thus <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> was complete only for a moment. Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie had barely been completed when the demolition of the old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louvre_Palace" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Louvre</span> was begun.</p>
<p>After that, the great city became more disfigured every day. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, beneath which Roman <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> was effaced, was effaced in its turn; but can any one say what <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> has replaced it?</p>
<p>There is the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catherine_de'_Medici" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Catherine de Medicis</span> at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tuileries_Palace" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Tuileries</span>;*—the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> of Henri II., at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hôtel_de_Ville,_Paris" property="schema:name">Hôtel de Ville</span>, two edifices still in fine taste;—the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> of Henri IV., at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Place_des_Vosges" property="schema:name">Place Royale</span>: façades of brick with stone corners, and slated roofs, tri-colored houses;—the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIII_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XIII</span>., at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Val-de-Grâce" property="schema:name">Val-de-Grace</span>: a crushed and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Squatting" property="schema:name">squat</span> architecture, with vaults like basket-handles, and something indescribably pot-bellied in the column, and thickset in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dome" property="schema:name">dome</span>;—the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rococo" property="schema:name">Louis XIV</span>., in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Les_Invalides" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Invalides</span>: grand, rich, gilded, cold;—the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rococo" property="schema:name">Louis XV</span>., in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sulpitius_the_Pious" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint-Sulpice</span>: <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volute" property="schema:name">volutes</span>, knots of ribbon, clouds, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vermicelli" property="schema:name">vermicelli</span> and chiccory leaves, all in stone;—the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neoclassicism" property="schema:name">Louis XVI</span>., in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pantheon,_Rome" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Pantheon</span>: Saint Peter of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Rome</span>, badly copied (the edifice is awkwardly heaped together, which has not amended its lines);—the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> of the Republic, in the School of Medicine: a poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece" property="schema:name">Greek</span> and Roman taste, which resembles the Coliseum or the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parthenon" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Parthenon</span> as the constitution of the year III., resembles the laws of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minos" property="schema:name">Minos</span>,—it is called in architecture, "the Messidor"** taste;—the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Napoleon</span> in the Place Vendome: this one is sublime, a column of bronze made of cannons;—the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourbon_Restoration" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Restoration</span>, at the Bourse: a very white <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonnade" property="schema:name">colonnade</span> supporting a very smooth <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frieze" property="schema:name">frieze</span>; the whole is square and cost twenty millions.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  We have seen with sorrow mingled with indignation, that it<br/>is the intention to increase, to recast, to make over, that is to say,<br/>to destroy this admirable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace_of_Versailles" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">palace</span>. The architects of our day have too<br/>heavy a hand to touch these delicate works of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance" property="schema:name">Renaissance</span>. We still<br/>cherish a hope that they will not dare. Moreover, this demolition of the<br/><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tuileries_Palace" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Tuileries</span> now, would be not only a brutal deed of violence, which<br/>would make a drunken vandal blush—it would be an act of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treason" property="schema:name">treason</span>.<br/>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tuileries_Palace" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Tuileries</span> is not simply a masterpiece of the art of the sixteenth<br/>century, it is a page of the history of the nineteenth. This <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace_of_Versailles" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">palace</span> no<br/>longer belongs to the king, but to the people. Let us leave it as it is.<br/>Our revolution has twice set its seal upon its front. On one of its two<br/>façades, there are the cannon-balls of the 10th of August; on the other,<br/>the balls of the 29th of July. It is sacred. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, April 1, 1831. (Note<br/>to the fifth edition.)<br/><br/>     **  The tenth month of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Republican_Calendar" property="schema:name">French republican calendar</span>, from the<br/>19th of June to the 18th of July.<br/></div>
<p>To each of these characteristic monuments there is attached by a similarity of taste, fashion, and attitude, a certain number of houses scattered about in different quarters and which the eyes of the connoisseur easily distinguishes and furnishes with a date. When one knows how to look, one finds the spirit of a century, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physiognomy" property="schema:name">physiognomy</span> of a king, even in the knocker on a door.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> of the present day has then, no general <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physiognomy" property="schema:name">physiognomy</span>. It is a collection of specimens of many centuries, and the finest have disappeared. The capital grows only in houses, and what houses! At the rate at which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> is now proceeding, it will renew itself every fifty years.</p>
<p>Thus the historical significance of its architecture is being effaced every day. Monuments are becoming rarer and rarer, and one seems to see them gradually engulfed, by the flood of houses. Our fathers had a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> of stone; our sons will have one of plaster.</p>
<p>So far as the modern monuments of new <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> are concerned, we would gladly be excused from mentioning them. It is not that we do not admire them as they deserve. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Panthéon,_Paris" property="schema:name">Sainte-Geneviève</span> of M. Soufflot is certainly the finest <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savoy" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Savoy</span> cake that has <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electronvolt" property="schema:name">ev</span>er been made in stone. The Palace of the Legion of Honor is also a v<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/ER_(TV_series)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">er</span>y distinguished bit of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pastry" property="schema:name">pastry</span>. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dome" property="schema:name">dome</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wheat" property="schema:name">wheat</span> market is an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">English</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Equestrian_helmet" property="schema:name">jockey cap</span>, on a grand scale. The towers of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sulpitius_the_Pious" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint-Sulpice</span> are two huge <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clarinet" property="schema:name">clarinets</span>, and the form is as good as any other; the telegraph, contorted and grimacing, forms an admirable accident upon their roofs. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Roch,_Paris" property="schema:name">Saint-Roch</span> has a door which, for magnificence, is comparable only to that of Saint-Thomas d'Aquin. It has, also, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crucifixion" property="schema:name">crucifixion</span> in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Relief" property="schema:name">high relief</span>, in a cellar, with a sun of gilded wood. These things are fairly marvellous. The lantern of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labyrinth" property="schema:name">labyrinth</span> of the Jardin des Plantes is also very ingenious.</p>
<p>As for the Palace of the Bourse, which is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece" property="schema:name">Greek</span> as to its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonnade" property="schema:name">colonnade</span>, Roman in the round arches of its doors and windows, of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance" property="schema:name">Renaissance</span> by virtue of its flattened vault, it is indubitably a very correct and very pure monument; the proof is that it is crowned with an attic, such as was never seen in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens" typeof="schema:AdministrativeArea" property="schema:name">Athens</span>, a beautiful, straight line, gracefully broken here and there by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chimney" property="schema:name">stovepipes</span>. Let us add that if it is according to rule that the architecture of a building should be adapted to its purpose in such a manner that this purpose shall be immediately apparent from the mere aspect of the building, one cannot be too much amazed at a structure which might be indifferently—the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace" property="schema:name">palace</span> of a king, a chamber of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communes_of_France" property="schema:name">communes</span>, a town-hall, a college, a riding-school, an academy, a warehouse, a court-house, a museum, a barracks, a sepulchre, a temple, or a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theatre" property="schema:name">theatre</span>. However, it is an Exchange. An edifice ought to be, moreover, suitable to the climate. This one is evidently constructed expressly for our cold and rainy skies. It has a roof almost as flat as roofs in the East, which involves sweeping the roof in winter, when it snows; and of course roofs are made to be swept. As for its purpose, of which we just spoke, it fulfils it to a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marvel_Comics" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">marvel</span>; it is a bourse in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span> as it would have been a temple in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece" property="schema:name">Greece</span>. It is true that the architect was at a good deal of trouble to conceal the clock face, which would have destroyed the purity of the fine lines of the façade; but, on the other hand, we have that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonnade" property="schema:name">colonnade</span> which circles round the edifice and under which, on days of high religious ceremony, the theories of the stock-brokers and the courtiers of commerce can be developed so majestically.</p>
<p>These are very superb structures. Let us add a quantity of fine, amusing, and varied streets, like the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rue_de_Rivoli,_Paris" property="schema:name">Rue de Rivoli</span>, and I do not despair of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> presenting to the eye, when viewed from a balloon, that richness of line, that opulence of detail, that diversity of aspect, that grandiose something in the simple, and unexpected in the beautiful, which characterizes a checker-board.</p>
<p>However, admirable as the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> of to-day may seem to you, reconstruct the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> of the fifteenth century, call it up before you in thought; look at the sky athwart that surprising forest of spires, towers, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">belfries</span>; spread out in the centre of the city, tear away at the point of the islands, fold at the arches of the bridges, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>, with its broad green and yellow expanses, more variable than the skin of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serpent_(symbolism)" property="schema:name">serpent</span>; project clearly against an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Azure_(color)" property="schema:name">azure</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horizon" property="schema:name">horizon</span> the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> profile of this ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. Make its contour float in a winter's mist which clings to its numerous chimneys; drown it in profound night and watch the odd play of lights and shadows in that sombre <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labyrinth" property="schema:name">labyrinth</span> of edifices; cast upon it a ray of light which shall vaguely outline it and cause to emerge from the fog the great heads of the towers; or take that black silhouette again, enliven with shadow the thousand acute angles of the spires and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gable" property="schema:name">gables</span>, and make it start out more toothed than a shark's jaw against a copper-colored western sky,—and then compare.</p>
<p>And if you wish to receive of the ancient city an impression with which the modern one can no longer furnish you, climb—on the morning of some grand festival, beneath the rising sun of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Easter" property="schema:name">Easter</span> or of Pentecost—climb upon some elevated point, whence you command the entire capital; and be present at the wakening of the chimes. Behold, at a signal given from heaven, for it is the sun which gives it, all those churches quiver simultaneously. First come scattered strokes, running from one church to another, as when musicians give warning that they are about to begin. Then, all at once, behold!—for it seems at times, as though the ear also possessed a sight of its own,—behold, rising from each bell tower, something like a column of sound, a cloud of harmony. First, the vibration of each bell mounts straight upwards, pure and, so to speak, isolated from the others, into the splendid morning sky; then, little by little, as they swell they melt together, mingle, are lost in each other, and amalgamate in a magnificent concert. It is no longer anything but a mass of sonorous vibrations incessantly sent forth from the numerous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">belfries</span>; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buoyancy" property="schema:name">floats</span>, undulates, bounds, whirls over the city, and prolongs far beyond the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Event_horizon" property="schema:name">horizon</span> the deafening circle of its oscillations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this sea of harmony is not a chaos; great and profound as it is, it has not lost its transparency; you behold the windings of each group of notes which escapes from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">belfries</span>. You can follow the dialogue, by turns grave and shrill, of the treble and the bass; you can see the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Octave" property="schema:name">octaves</span> leap from one tower to another; you watch them spring forth, winged, light, and whistling, from the silver bell, to fall, broken and limping from the bell of wood; you admire in their midst the rich gamut which incessantly ascends and re-ascends the seven bells of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Eustache,_Paris" property="schema:name">Saint-Eustache</span>; you see light and rapid notes running across it, executing three or four luminous zigzags, and vanishing like flashes of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lightning" property="schema:name">lightning</span>. Yonder is the Abbey of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Martin" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Martin</span>, a shrill, cracked singer; here the gruff and gloomy voice of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution" property="schema:name">Bastille</span>; at the other end, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keep" property="schema:name">great tower</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Louvre" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Louvre</span>, with its bass. The royal chime of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace" property="schema:name">palace</span> scatters on all sides, and without relaxation, resplendent <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trill_(music)" property="schema:name">trills</span>, upon which fall, at regular intervals, the heavy strokes from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">belfry</span> of Notre-Dame, which makes them <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparkle_(1976_film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">sparkle</span> like the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anvil" property="schema:name">anvil</span> under the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hammer" property="schema:name">hammer</span>. At intervals you behold the passage of sounds of all forms which come from the triple <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">peal</span> of Saint-Germaine des Prés. Then, again, from time to time, this mass of sublime noises opens and gives passage to the beats of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hail_Mary" property="schema:name">Ave Maria</span>, which bursts forth and sparkles like an aigrette of stars. Below, in the very depths of the concert, you confusedly distinguish the interior chanting of the churches, which exhales through the vibrating pores of their vaulted roofs.</p>
<p>Assuredly, this is an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera" property="schema:name">opera</span> which it is worth the trouble of listening to. Ordinarily, the noise which escapes from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> by day is the city speaking; by night, it is the city breathing; in this case, it is the city singing. Lend an ear, then, to this concert of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell towers</span>; spread over all the murmur of half a million men, the eternal plaint of the river, the infinite breathings of the wind, the grave and distant quartette of the four forests arranged upon the hills, on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Observable_universe" property="schema:name">horizon</span>, like immense stacks of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pipe_organ" property="schema:name">organ pipes</span>; extinguish, as in a half shade, all that is too hoarse and too shrill about the central chime, and say whether you know anything in the world more rich and joyful, more golden, more dazzling, than this tumult of bells and chimes;—than this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span> of music,—than these ten thousand brazen voices chanting simultaneously in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flute" property="schema:name">flutes</span> of stone, three hundred feet high,—than this city which is no longer anything but an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra" property="schema:name">orchestra</span>,—than this symphony which produces the noise of a tempest.</p>
