<h2 id="pgepubid00049">CHAPTER VIII. THE UTILITY OF WINDOWS WHICH OPEN ON THE RIVER.</h2>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> (for we presume that the reader, more intelligent than <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, has seen in this whole <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adventure_game" property="schema:name">adventure</span> no other surly monk than the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>), <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> groped about for several moments in the dark lair into which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> had bolted him. It was one of those nooks which architects sometimes reserve at the point of junction between the roof and the supporting wall. A vertical section of this kennel, as <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> had so justly styled it, would have made a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triangle" property="schema:name">triangle</span>. Moreover, there was neither window nor air-hole, and the slope of the roof prevented one from standing upright. Accordingly, Claude crouched down in the dust, and the plaster which cracked beneath him; his head was on fire; rummaging around him with his hands, he found on the floor a bit of broken glass, which he pressed to his brow, and whose cool-ness afforded him some relief.</p>
<p>What was taking place at that moment in the gloomy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>? <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> and himself could alone know.</p>
<p>In what order was he arranging in his mind <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, Jacques Charmolue, his young brother so beloved, yet abandoned by him in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bog" property="schema:name">mire</span>, his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>'s <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cassock" property="schema:name">cassock</span>, his reputation perhaps dragged to la Falourdel's, all these adventures, all these images? I cannot say. But it is certain that these ideas formed in his mind a horrible group.</p>
<p>He had been waiting a quarter of an hour; it seemed to him that he had grown a century older. All at once he heard the creaking of the boards of the stairway; some one was ascending. The trapdoor opened once more; a light reappeared. There was a tolerably large crack in the worm-eaten door of his den; he put his face to it. In this manner he could see all that went on in the adjoining room. The cat-faced old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hag" property="schema:name">crone</span> was the first to emerge from the trap-door, lamp in hand; then <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, twirling his moustache, then a third person, that beautiful and graceful figure, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span>. The priest beheld her rise from below like a dazzling apparition. Claude trembled, a cloud spread over his eyes, his pulses beat violently, everything rustled and whirled around him; he no longer saw nor heard anything.</p>
<p>When he recovered himself, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">Esmeralda</span> were alone seated on the wooden coffer beside the lamp which made these two youthful figures and a miserable pallet at the end of the attic stand out plainly before the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>'s eyes.</p>
<p>Beside the pallet was a window, whose panes broken like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider" property="schema:name">spider</span>'s web upon which rain has fallen, allowed a view, through its rent meshes, of a corner of the sky, and the moon lying far away on an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Down_feather" property="schema:name">eiderdown</span> bed of soft clouds.</p>
<p>The young girl was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blushing" property="schema:name">blushing</span>, confused, palpitating. Her long, drooping lashes shaded her crimson cheeks. The officer, to whom she dared not lift her eyes, was radiant. Mechanically, and with a charmingly unconscious gesture, she traced with the tip of her finger incoherent lines on the bench, and watched her finger. Her foot was not visible. The little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> was nestling upon it.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span> was very gallantly clad; he had tufts of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Embroidery" property="schema:name">embroidery</span> at his neck and wrists; a great elegance at that day.</p>
<p>It was not without difficulty that Dom Claude managed to hear what they were saying, through the humming of the blood, which was boiling in his temples.</p>
<p>(A conversation between lovers is a very commonplace affair. It is a perpetual "I love you." A musical phrase which is very insipid and very bald for indifferent listeners, when it is not ornamented with some <i>fioriture</i>; but Claude was not an indifferent listener.)</p>
<p>"Oh!" said the young girl, without raising her eyes, "do not despise me, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monsignor" property="schema:name">monseigneur</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>. I feel that what I am doing is not right."</p>
<p>"Despise you, my pretty child!" replied the officer with an air of superior and distinguished gallantry, "despise you, <i>tête-Dieu</i>! and why?"</p>
<p>"For having followed you!"</p>
<p>"On that point, my beauty, we don't agree. I ought not to despise you, but to hate you."</p>
<p>The young girl looked at him in affright: "Hate me! what have I done?"</p>
<p>"For having required so much urging."</p>
<p>"Alas!" said she, "'tis because I am breaking a vow. I shall not find my parents! The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amulet" property="schema:name">amulet</span> will lose its virtue. But what matters it? What need have I of father or mother now?"</p>
<p>So saying, she fixed upon the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span> her great black eyes, moist with joy and tenderness.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Devil" property="schema:name">Devil</span> take me if I understand you!" exclaimed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">La Esmeralda</span> remained <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span> for a moment, then a tear dropped from her eyes, a sigh from her lips, and she said,—"Oh! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monsignor" property="schema:name">monseigneur</span>, I love you."</p>
<p>Such a perfume of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chastity" property="schema:name">chastity</span>, such a charm of virtue surrounded the young girl, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> did not feel completely at his ease beside her. But this remark emboldened him: "You love me!" he said with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rapture" property="schema:name">rapture</span>, and he threw his arm round the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s waist. He had only been waiting for this opportunity.</p>
<p>The priest saw it, and tested with the tip of his finger the point of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poignard" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">poniard</span> which he wore concealed in his breast.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>," continued the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemian" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span>, gently releasing her waist from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>'s tenacious hands, "You are good, you are generous, you are handsome; you saved me, me who am only a poor child lost in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bohemia</span>. I had long been dreaming of an officer who should save my life. 'Twas of you that I was dreaming, before I knew you, my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>; the officer of my dream had a beautiful uniform like yours, a grand look, a sword; your name is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>; 'tis a beautiful name. I love your name; I love your sword. Draw your sword, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, that I may see it."</p>
<p>"Child!" said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>, and he unsheathed his sword with a smile.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> looked at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hilt" property="schema:name">hilt</span>, the blade; examined the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cipher" property="schema:name">cipher</span> on the guard with adorable curiosity, and kissed the sword, saying,—</p>
<p>"You are the sword of a brave man. I love my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>." <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> again profited by the opportunity to impress upon her beautiful bent neck a kiss which made the young girl straighten herself up as scarlet as a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pop_music" property="schema:name">poppy</span>. The priest gnashed his teeth over it in the dark.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>," resumed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, "let me talk to you. Pray walk a little, that I may see you at full height, and that I may hear your spurs <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jingle" property="schema:name">jingle</span>. How handsome you are!"</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> rose to please her, chiding her with a smile of satisfaction,—</p>
<p>"What a child you are! By the way, my charmer, have you seen me in my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archery" property="schema:name">archer</span>'s ceremonial <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doublet_(clothing)" property="schema:name">doublet</span>?"</p>
<p>"Alas! no," she replied.</p>
<p>"It is very handsome!"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> returned and seated himself beside her, but much closer than before.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Listen_(Beyoncé_Knowles_song)" property="schema:name">Listen</span>, my dear—"</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> gave him several little taps with her pretty hand on his mouth, with a childish mirth and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grace_(prayer)" property="schema:name">grace</span> and gayety.</p>
<p>"No, no, I will not listen to you. Do you love me? I want you to tell me whether you love me."</p>
<p>"Do I love thee, angel of my life!" exclaimed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>, half kneeling. "My body, my blood, my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, all are thine; all are for thee. I love thee, and I have never loved any one but thee."</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> had repeated this phrase so many times, in many similar <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business_cycle" property="schema:name">conjunctures</span>, that he delivered it all in one breath, without committing a single mistake. At this passionate declaration, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> raised to the dirty ceiling which served for the skies a glance full of angelic <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Happiness" property="schema:name">happiness</span>.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathy_voice" property="schema:name">murmured</span>, "this is the moment when one should die!"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> found "the moment" favorable for robbing her of another kiss, which went to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Torture" property="schema:name">torture</span> the unhappy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> in his nook. "Die!" exclaimed the amorous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>, "What are you saying, my lovely angel? 'Tis a time for living, or Jupiter is only a scamp! Die at the beginning of so sweet a thing! <i>Corne-de-boeuf</i>, what a jest! It is not that. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Listen_(Beyoncé_Knowles_song)" property="schema:name">Listen</span>, my dear Similar, Esmenarda—Pardon! you have so prodigiously <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saracen" property="schema:name">Saracen</span> a name that I never can get it straight. 'Tis a thicket which stops me short."</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" said the poor girl, "and I thought my name pretty because of its singularity! But since it displeases you, I would that I were called Goton."</p>
<p>"Ah! do not weep for such a trifle, my graceful maid! 'tis a name to which one must get accustomed, that is all. When I once know it by heart, all will go smoothly. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Listen_(Beyoncé_Knowles_song)" property="schema:name">Listen</span> then, my dear Similar; I adore you passionately. I love you so that 'tis simply miraculous. I know a girl who is bursting with rage over it—"</p>
<p>The jealous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Girl,_Interrupted_(film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">girl interrupted</span> him: "Who?"</p>
<p>"What matters that to us?" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>; "do you love me?"</p>
<p>"Oh!"—said she.</p>
<p>"Well! that is all. You shall see how I love you also. May the great devil <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neptune_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Neptunus</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spear" property="schema:name">spear</span> me if I do not make you the happiest woman in the world. We will have a pretty little house somewhere. I will make my archers parade before your windows. They are all mounted, and set at defiance those of Captain <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mignon" property="schema:name">Mignon</span>. There are <i>voulgiers, cranequiniers</i> and hand <i>couleveiniers</i>*. I will take you to the great sights of the Parisians at the storehouse of Rully. Eighty thousand armed men, thirty thousand white harnesses, short coats or coats of mail; the sixty-seven banners of the trades; the standards of the parliaments, of the chamber of accounts, of the treasury of the generals, of the aides of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mint_(coin)" property="schema:name">mint</span>; a devilish fine array, in short! I will conduct you to see the lions of the Hôtel du Roi, which are wild beasts. All women love that."</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     * Varieties of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crossbow" property="schema:name">crossbow</span>.<br/></div>
<p>For several moments the young girl, absorbed in her charming thoughts, was dreaming to the sound of his voice, without listening to the sense of his words.</p>
<p>"Oh! how happy you will be!" continued the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>, and at the same time he gently unbuckled the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s girdle.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" she said quickly. This "act of violence" had roused her from her revery.</p>
<p>"Nothing," replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, "I was only saying that you must abandon all this garb of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folly" property="schema:name">folly</span>, and the street corner when you are with me."</p>
<p>"When I am with you, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>!" said the young girl tenderly.</p>
<p>She became pensive and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span> once more.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>, emboldened by her gentleness, clasped her waist without resistance; then began softly to unlace the poor child's corsage, and disarranged her tucker to such an extent that the panting priest beheld the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s beautiful shoulder emerge from the gauze, as round and brown as the moon rising through the mists of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horus" property="schema:name">horizon</span>.</p>
<p>The young girl allowed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> to have his way. She did not appear to perceive it. The eye of the bold <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> flashed.</p>
<p>Suddenly she turned towards him,—</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>," she said, with an expression of infinite love, "instruct me in thy religion."</p>
<p>"My religion!" exclaimed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>, bursting with laughter, "I instruct you in my religion! <i>Corne et <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">tonnerre</span></i>! What do you want with my religion?"</p>
<p>"In order that we may be married," she replied.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>'s face assumed an expression of mingled surprise and disdain, of carelessness and libertine passion.</p>
<p>"Ah, bah!" said he, "do people marry?"</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemianism" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span> turned pale, and her head drooped sadly on her breast.</p>
<p>"My beautiful love," resumed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, tenderly, "what nonsense is this? A great thing is marriage, truly! one is none the less loving for not having <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spit_(landform)" property="schema:name">spit</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span> into a priest's shop!"</p>
<p>While speaking thus in his softest voice, he approached extremely near the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>; his caressing hands resumed their place around her supple and delicate waist, his eye flashed more and more, and everything announced that Monsieur <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> was on the verge of one of those moments when <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span> himself commits so many <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folly" property="schema:name">follies</span> that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Homer</span> is obliged to summon a cloud to his rescue.</p>
<p>But Dom Claude saw everything. The door was made of thoroughly rotten <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barrel" property="schema:name">cask</span> staves, which left large apertures for the passage of his hawklike gaze. This brown-skinned, broad-shouldered priest, hitherto condemned to the austere <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Virginity" property="schema:name">virginity</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span>, was quivering and boiling in the presence of this night scene of love and voluptuousness. This young and beautiful girl given over in disarray to the ardent young man, made melted lead flow in his-veins; his eyes darted with sensual jealousy beneath all those loosened pins. Any one who could, at that moment, have seen the face of the unhappy man glued to the wormeaten bars, would have thought that he beheld the face of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiger" property="schema:name">tiger</span> glaring from the depths of a cage at some jackal devouring a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gazelle" property="schema:name">gazelle</span>. His eye shone like a candle through the cracks of the door.</p>
<p>All at once, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, with a rapid gesture, removed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s gorgerette. The poor child, who had remained pale and dreamy, awoke with a start; she recoiled hastily from the enterprising officer, and, casting a glance at her bare neck and shoulders, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span>, confused, mute with shame, she crossed her two beautiful arms on her breast to conceal it. Had it not been for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire" property="schema:name">flame</span> which burned in her cheeks, at the sight of her so <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span> and motionless, one would have declared her a statue of Modesty. Her eyes were lowered.</p>
<p>But the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>'s gesture had revealed the mysterious <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amulet" property="schema:name">amulet</span> which she wore about her neck.</p>
<p>"What is that?" he said, seizing this pretext to approach once more the beautiful creature whom he had just alarmed.</p>
<p>"Don't touch it!" she replied, quickly, "'tis my guardian. It will make me find my family again, if I remain worthy to do so. Oh, leave me, monsieur le capitaine! My mother! My poor mother! My mother! Where art thou? Come to my rescue! Have pity, Monsieur <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, give me back my gorgerette!"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> retreated amid said in a cold tone,—</p>
<p>"Oh, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prince_du_sang" property="schema:name">mademoiselle</span>! I see plainly that you do not love me!"</p>
<p>"I do not love him!" exclaimed the unhappy child, and at the same time she clung to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>, whom she drew to a seat beside her. "I do not love thee, my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>? What art thou saying, wicked man, to break my heart? Oh, take me! take all! do what you will with me, I am thine. What matters to me the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amulet" property="schema:name">amulet</span>! What matters to me my mother! 'Tis thou who art my mother since I love thee! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, my beloved <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, dost thou see me? 'Tis I. Look at me; 'tis the little one whom thou wilt surely not repulse, who comes, who comes herself to seek thee. My <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, my life, my body, my person, all is one thing—which is thine, my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>. Well, no! We will not marry, since that displeases thee; and then, what am I? a miserable girl of the gutters; whilst thou, my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, art a gentleman. A fine thing, truly! A dancer wed an officer! I was mad. No, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, no; I will be thy mistress, thy amusement, thy pleasure, when thou wilt; a girl who shall belong to thee. I was only made for that, soiled, despised, dishonored, but what matters it?—beloved. I shall be the proudest and the most joyous of women. And when I grow old or ugly, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, when I am no longer good to love you, you will suffer me to serve you still. Others will embroider scarfs for you; 'tis I, the servant, who will care for them. You will let me polish your spurs, brush your <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doublet_(clothing)" property="schema:name">doublet</span>, dust your riding-boots. You will have that pity, will you not, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>? Meanwhile, take me! here, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, all this belongs to thee, only love me! We gypsies need only air and love."</p>
<p>So saying, she threw her arms round the officer's neck; she looked up at him, supplicatingly, with a beautiful smile, and all in tears. Her delicate neck rubbed against his cloth <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doublet_(clothing)" property="schema:name">doublet</span> with its rough embroideries. She writhed on her knees, her beautiful body half naked. The intoxicated <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> pressed his ardent lips to those lovely African shoulders. The young girl, her eyes bent on the ceiling, as she leaned backwards, quivered, all palpitating, beneath this kiss.</p>
<p>All at once, above <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>'s head she beheld another head; a green, livid, convulsed face, with the look of a lost <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>; near this face was a hand grasping a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poignard" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">poniard</span>.—It was the face and hand of the priest; he had broken the door and he was there. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> could not see him. The young girl remained motionless, frozen with terror, dumb, beneath that terrible apparition, like a dove which should raise its head at the moment when the hawk is gazing into her nest with its round eyes.</p>
<p>She could not even utter a cry. She saw the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poignard" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">poniard</span> descend upon <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, and rise again, reeking.</p>
<p>"Maledictions!" said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>, and fell.</p>
<p>She fainted.</p>
<p>At the moment when her eyes closed, when all feeling vanished in her, she thought that she felt a touch of fire imprinted upon her lips, a kiss more burning than the red-hot <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> of the executioner.</p>
<p>When she recovered her senses, she was surrounded by soldiers of the watch they were carrying away the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>, bathed in his blood the priest had disappeared; the window at the back of the room which opened on the river was wide open; they picked up a cloak which they supposed to belong to the officer and she heard them saying around her,</p>
<p>"'Tis a sorceress who has stabbed a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>."</p>

<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> and the entire Court of Miracles were suffering mortal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anxiety" property="schema:name">anxiety</span>. For a whole month they had not known what had become of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span>, which greatly pained the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egypt</span> and his friends the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span>, nor what had become of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, which redoubled <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>'s grief. One evening the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> had disappeared, and since that time had given no signs of life. All search had proved fruitless. Some tormenting bootblacks had told <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> about meeting her that same evening near the Pont Saint-Michel, going off with an officer; but this husband, after the fashion of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bohemia</span>, was an incredulous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span>, and besides, he, better than any one else, knew to what a point his wife was virginal. He had been able to form a judgment as to the unconquerable modesty resulting from the combined virtues of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amulet" property="schema:name">amulet</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, and he had mathematically calculated the resistance of that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chastity" property="schema:name">chastity</span> to the second power. Accordingly, he was at ease on that score.</p>
<p>Still he could not understand this disappearance. It was a profound sorrow. He would have grown thin over it, had that been possible. He had forgotten everything, even his literary tastes, even his great work, <i>De figuris regularibus et irregularibus</i>, which it was his intention to have printed with the first money which he should procure (for he had raved over printing, ever since he had seen the "Didascalon" of Hugues de Saint Victor, printed with the celebrated characters of Vindelin de Spire).</p>
<p>One day, as he was passing sadly before the criminal Tournelle, he perceived a considerable crowd at one of the gates of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law_Courts_of_Brussels" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Palais de Justice</span>.</p>
<p>"What is this?" he inquired of a young man who was coming out.</p>
<p>"I know not, sir," replied the young man. "'Tis said that they are trying a woman who hath assassinated a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gendarmerie" property="schema:name">gendarme</span>. It appears that there is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">sorcery</span> at the bottom of it, the archbishop and the official have intervened in the case, and my brother, who is the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> of Josas, can think of nothing else. Now, I wished to speak with him, but I have not been able to reach him because of the throng, which vexes me greatly, as I stand in need of money."</p>
<p>"Alas! sir," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "I would that I could lend you some, but, my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breeches" property="schema:name">breeches</span> are worn to holes, and 'tis not crowns which have done it."</p>
<p>He dared not tell the young man that he was acquainted with his brother the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, to whom he had not returned after the scene in the church; a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Negligence" property="schema:name">negligence</span> which embarrassed him.</p>
<p>The scholar went his way, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> set out to follow the crowd which was mounting the staircase of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_chamber" property="schema:name">great chamber</span>. In his opinion, there was nothing like the spectacle of a criminal process for dissipating melancholy, so exhilaratingly stupid are judges as a rule. The populace which he had joined walked and elbowed in silence. After a slow and tiresome march through a long, gloomy corridor, which wound through the court-house like the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intestine" property="schema:name">intestinal canal</span> of the ancient edifice, he arrived near a low door, opening upon a hall which his lofty stature permitted him to survey with a glance over the waving heads of the rabble.</p>
<p>The hall was vast and gloomy, which latter fact made it appear still more spacious. The day was declining; the long, pointed windows permitted only a pale ray of light to enter, which was extinguished before it reached the vaulted ceiling, an enormous trellis-work of sculptured beams, whose thousand figures seemed to move confusedly in the shadows, many candles were already lighted here and there on tables, and beaming on the heads of clerks buried in masses of documents. The anterior portion of the ball was occupied by the crowd; on the right and left were magistrates and tables; at the end, upon a platform, a number of judges, whose rear rank sank into the shadows, sinister and motionless faces. The walls were sown with innumerable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">fleurs-de-lis</span>. A large figure of Christ might be vaguely descried above the judges, and everywhere there were <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pike_(weapon)" property="schema:name">pikes</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Halberd" property="schema:name">halberds</span>, upon whose points the reflection of the candles placed tips of fire.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> inquired of one of his neighbors, "who are all those persons ranged yonder, like <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prelate" property="schema:name">prelates</span> in council?"</p>
<p>"Monsieur," replied the neighbor, "those on the right are the counsellors of the grand chamber; those on the left, the councillors of inquiry; the masters in black gowns, the messires in red."</p>
<p>"Who is that big red fellow, yonder above them, who is sweating?" pursued <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p>"It is monsieur the president."</p>
<p>"And those <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sheep" property="schema:name">sheep</span> behind him?" continued <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, who as we have seen, did not love the magistracy, which arose, possibly, from the grudge which he cherished against the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law_Courts_of_Brussels" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Palais de Justice</span> since his dramatic misadventure.</p>
<p>"They are messieurs the masters of requests of the king's household."</p>
<p>"And that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wild_boar" property="schema:name">boar</span> in front of him?"</p>
<p>"He is monsieur the clerk of the Court of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parliament" property="schema:name">Parliament</span>."</p>
<p>"And that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crocodile" property="schema:name">crocodile</span> on the right?"</p>
<p>"Master Philippe Lheulier, advocate extraordinary of the king."</p>
<p>"And that big, black tom-cat on the left?"</p>
<p>"Master Jacques Charmolue, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Promagistrate" property="schema:name">procurator</span> of the king in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ecclesiastical_court" property="schema:name">Ecclesiastical Court</span>, with the gentlemen of the officialty."</p>
<p>"Come now, monsieur," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "pray what are all those fine fellows doing yonder?"</p>
<p>"They are judging."</p>
<p>"Judging whom? I do not see the accused."</p>
<p>"'Tis a woman, sir. You cannot see her. She has her back turned to us, and she is hidden from us by the crowd. Stay, yonder she is, where you see a group of partisans."</p>
<p>"Who is the woman?" asked <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>. "Do you know her name?"</p>
<p>"No, monsieur, I have but just arrived. I merely assume that there is some sorcery about it, since the official is present at the trial."</p>
<p>"Come!" said our <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span>, "we are going to see all these magistrates devour human flesh. 'Tis as good a spectacle as any other."</p>
<p>"Monsieur," remarked his neighbor, "think you not, that Master Jacques Charmolue has a very sweet air?"</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zachlumia" property="schema:name">Hum</span>!" replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>. "I distrust a sweetness which hath pinched nostrils and thin lips."</p>
<p>Here the bystanders imposed silence upon the two chatterers. They were listening to an important deposition.</p>
<p>"Messeigneurs," said an old woman in the middle of the hall, whose form was so concealed beneath her garments that one would have pronounced her a walking <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spoil_tip" property="schema:name">heap</span> of rags; "Messeigneurs, the thing is as true as that I am la Falourdel, established these forty years at the Pont <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_(archangel)" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint Michel</span>, and paying regularly my rents, lord's dues, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quit-rent" property="schema:name">quit rents</span>; at the gate opposite the house of Tassin-Caillart, the dyer, which is on the side up the river—a poor old woman now, but a pretty maid in former days, my lords. Some one said to me lately, 'La Falourdel, don't use your spinning-wheel too much in the evening; the devil is fond of combing the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Distaff" property="schema:name">distaffs</span> of old women with his horns. 'Tis certain that the surly monk who was round about the temple last year, now prowls in the City. Take care, La Falourdel, that he doth not knock at your door.' One evening I was spinning on my wheel, there comes a knock at my door; I ask who it is. They swear. I open. Two men enter. A man in black and a handsome officer. Of the black man nothing could be seen but his eyes, two coals of fire. All the rest was hat and cloak. They say to me,—'The Sainte-Marthe chamber.'—'Tis my upper chamber, my lords, my cleanest. They give me a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span>. I put the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span> in my drawer, and I say: 'This shall go to buy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tripe" property="schema:name">tripe</span> at the slaughter-house of la Gloriette to-morrow.' We go up stairs. On arriving at the upper chamber, and while my back is turned, the black man disappears. That dazed me a bit. The officer, who was as handsome as a great lord, goes down stairs again with me. He goes out. In about the time it takes to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spinning_(textiles)" property="schema:name">spin</span> a quarter of a handful of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flax" property="schema:name">flax</span>, he returns with a beautiful young girl, a doll who would have shone like the sun had she been coiffed. She had with her a goat; a big billy-<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, whether black or white, I no longer remember. That set me to thinking. The girl does not concern me, but the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>! I love not those beasts, they have a beard and horns. They are so like a man. And then, they smack of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witches</span>, sabbath. However, I say nothing. I had the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span>. That is right, is it not, Monsieur Judge? I show the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> and the wench to the upper chamber, and I leave them alone; that is to say, with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>. I go down and set to spinning again—I must inform you that my house has a ground floor and story above. I know not why I fell to thinking of the surly monk whom the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> had put into my head again, and then the beautiful girl was rather strangely decked out. All at once, I hear a cry upstairs, and something falls on the floor and the window opens. I run to mine which is beneath it, and I behold a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Mass" property="schema:name">black mass</span> pass before my eyes and fall into the water. It was a phantom clad like a priest. It was a moonlight night. I saw him quite plainly. He was swimming in the direction of the city. Then, all of a tremble, I call the watch. The gentlemen of the police enter, and not knowing just at the first moment what the matter was, and being merry, they beat me. I explain to them. We go up stairs, and what do we find? my poor chamber all blood, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> stretched out at full length with a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dagger" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">dagger</span> in his neck, the girl pretending to be dead, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> all in a fright. 'Pretty work!' I say, 'I shall have to wash that floor for more than a fortnight. It will have to be scraped; it will be a terrible job.' They carried off the officer, poor young man, and the wench with her bosom all bare. But wait, the worst is that on the next day, when I wanted to take the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span> to buy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tripe" property="schema:name">tripe</span>, I found a dead leaf in its place."</p>
<p>The old woman ceased. A murmur of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horror_film" property="schema:name">horror</span> ran through the audience.</p>
<p>"That phantom, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>,—all smacks of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span>," said one of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>'s neighbors.</p>
<p>"And that dry leaf!" added another.</p>
<p>"No doubt about it," joined in a third, "she is a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witch</span> who has dealings with the surly monk, for the purpose of plundering officers."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> himself was not disinclined to regard this as altogether alarming and probable.</p>
<p>"Goody Falourdel," said the president majestically, "have you nothing more to communicate to the court?"</p>
<p>"No, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monsignor" property="schema:name">monseigneur</span>," replied the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hag" property="schema:name">crone</span>, "except that the report has described my house as a hovel and stinking; which is an outrageous fashion of speaking. The houses on the bridge are not imposing, because there are such multitudes of people; but, nevertheless, the butchers continue to dwell there, who are wealthy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folklore" property="schema:name">folk</span>, and married to very proper and handsome women."</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magistrate" property="schema:name">magistrate</span> who had reminded <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crocodile" property="schema:name">crocodile</span> rose,—</p>
<p>"Silence!" said he. "I pray the gentlemen not to lose sight of the fact that a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dagger" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">dagger</span> was found on the person of the accused. Goody Falourdel, have you brought that leaf into which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Crown" property="schema:name">crown</span> which the demon gave you was transformed?</p>
<p>"Yes, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monsignor" property="schema:name">monseigneur</span>," she replied; "I found it again. Here it is."</p>
<p>A <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> banded the dead leaf to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crocodile" property="schema:name">crocodile</span>, who made a doleful shake of the head, and passed it on to the president, who gave it to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Procurator_(Roman)" property="schema:name">procurator</span> of the king in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ecclesiastical_court" property="schema:name">ecclesiastical court</span>, and thus it made the circuit of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hail" property="schema:name">hail</span>.</p>
<p>"It is a birch leaf," said Master Jacques Charmolue. "A fresh proof of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span>."</p>
<p>A counsellor took up the word.</p>
<p>"Witness, two men went upstairs together in your house: the black man, whom you first saw disappear and afterwards swimming in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>, with his priestly garments, and the officer. Which of the two handed you the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Crown" property="schema:name">crown</span>?" The old woman pondered for a moment and then said,—"The officer."</p>
<p>A murmur ran through the crowd.</p>
<p>"Ah!" thought <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "this makes some doubt in my mind."</p>
<p>But Master Philippe Lheulier, advocate extraordinary to the king, interposed once more.</p>
<p>"I will recall to these gentlemen, that in the deposition taken at his bedside, the assassinated officer, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Women's_Health_Initiative" property="schema:name">whi</span>le declaring that he had a vague idea when the black man accosted him that the latter might be the surly monk, added that the phantom had pressed him eagerly to go and make acquaintance with the accused; and upon his, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>'s, remarking that he had no money, he had given him the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span> which the said officer paid to la Falourdel. Hence, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span> is the money of hell."</p>
<p>This conclusive observation appeared to dissipate all the doubts of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> and the other sceptics in the audience.</p>
<p>"You have the documents, gentlemen," added the king's advocate, as he took his seat; "you can consult the testimony of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> de Châteaupers."</p>
<p>At that name, the accused sprang up, her head rose above the throng. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horror_film" property="schema:name">horror</span> recognized <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span>.</p>
<p>She was pale; her tresses, formerly so gracefully braided and spangled with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sequin_(coin)" property="schema:name">sequins</span>, hung in disorder; her lips were blue, her hollow eyes were terrible. Alas!</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>!" she said, in bewilderment; "where is he? O messeigneurs! before you kill me, tell me, for pity sake, whether he still lives?"</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue, woman," replied the president, "that is no affair of ours."</p>
<p>"Oh! for mercy's sake, tell me if he is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alive!_(Kiss_album)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">alive!</span>" she repeated, clasping her beautiful emaciated hands; and the sound of her chains in contact with her dress, was heard.</p>
<p>"Well!" said the king's advocate roughly, "he is dying. Are you satisfied?"</p>
<p>The unhappy girl fell back on her criminal's seat, speechless, tearless, white as a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wax" property="schema:name">wax</span> figure.</p>
<p>The president bent down to a man at his feet, who wore a gold cap and a black gown, a chain on his neck and a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wand" property="schema:name">wand</span> in his hand.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">Bailiff</span>, bring in the second accused."</p>
<p>All eyes turned towards a small door, which opened, and, to the great agitation of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, gave passage to a pretty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> with horns and hoofs of gold. The elegant beast halted for a moment on the threshold, stretching out its neck as though, perched on the summit of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rock_music" property="schema:name">rock</span>, it had before its eyes an immense <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horus" property="schema:name">horizon</span>. Suddenly it caught sight of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> girl, and leaping over the table and the head of a clerk, in two bounds it was at her knees; then it rolled gracefully on its mistress's feet, soliciting a word or a caress; but the accused remained motionless, and poor Djali himself obtained not a glance.</p>
<p>"Eh, why—'tis my villanous beast," said old Falourdel, "I recognize the two perfectly!"</p>
<p>Jacques Charmolue interfered.</p>
<p>"If the gentlemen please, we will proceed to the examination of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>." He was, in fact, the second criminal. Nothing more simple in those days than a suit of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">sorcery</span> instituted against an animal. We find, among others in the accounts of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span>'s office for 1466, a curious detail concerning the expenses of the trial of Gillet-Soulart and his sow, "executed for their demerits," at Corbeil. Everything is there, the cost of the pens in which to place the sow, the five hundred bundles of brushwood purchased at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Port_and_starboard" property="schema:name">port</span> of Morsant, the three pints of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span> and the bread, the last repast of the victim fraternally shared by the executioner, down to the eleven days of guard and food for the sow, at eight deniers parisis each. Sometimes, they went even further than animals. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capitulary" property="schema:name">capitularies</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charlemagne</span> and of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_the_Pious" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis le Débonnaire</span> impose severe penalties on fiery phantoms which presume to appear in the air.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Procurator_(Roman)" property="schema:name">procurator</span> had exclaimed: "If the demon which possesses this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, and which has resisted all <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exorcism" property="schema:name">exorcisms</span>, persists in its deeds of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witchcraft</span>, if it alarms the court with them, we warn it that we shall be forced to put in requisition against it the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallows" property="schema:name">gallows</span> or the stake. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> broke out into a cold <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perspiration" property="schema:name">perspiration</span>. Charmolue took from the table the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span>, and presenting it to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, in a certain manner, asked the latter,—</p>
<p>"What o'clock is it?"</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> looked at it with an intelligent eye, raised its gilded <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoof" property="schema:name">hoof</span>, and struck seven blows.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, seven o'clock. A movement of terror ran through the crowd.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> could not endure it.</p>
<p>"He is destroying himself!" he cried aloud; "You see well that he does not know what he is doing."</p>
<p>"Silence among the louts at the end of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hail" property="schema:name">hail</span>!" said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> sharply.</p>
<p>Jacques Charmolue, by the aid of the same manoeuvres of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span>, made the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> perform many other tricks connected with the date of the day, the month of the year, etc., which the reader has already witnessed. And, by virtue of an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illusion" property="schema:name">optical illusion</span> peculiar to judicial proceedings, these same spectators who had, probably, more than once applauded in the public square Djali's innocent <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span> were terrified by it beneath the roof of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Courthouse" property="schema:name">Palais de Justice</span>. The goat was undoubtedly the devil.</p>
<p>It was far worse when the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public_procurator" property="schema:name">procurator</span> of the king, having emptied upon a floor a certain bag filled with movable letters, which Djali wore round his neck, they beheld the goat extract with his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoof" property="schema:name">hoof</span> from the scattered <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alphabet" property="schema:name">alphabet</span> the fatal name of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witchcraft</span> of which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span> had been the victim appeared irresistibly demonstrated, and in the eyes of all, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, that ravishing dancer, who had so often dazzled the passers-by with her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_grace" property="schema:name">grace</span>, was no longer anything but a frightful <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vampire" property="schema:name">vampire</span>.</p>
<p>However, she betrayed no sign of life; neither Djali's graceful evolutions, nor the menaces of the court, nor the suppressed imprecations of the spectators any longer reached her mind.</p>
<p>In order to arouse her, a police officer was obliged to shake her unmercifully, and the president had to raise his voice,—"Girl, you are of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span> race, addicted to deeds of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witchcraft</span>. You, in complicity with the bewitched goat implicated in this suit, during the night of the twenty-ninth of March last, murdered and stabbed, in concert with the powers of darkness, by the aid of charms and underhand practices, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span> of the king's arches of the watch, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> de Châteaupers. Do you persist in denying it?"</p>
<p>"Horror!" exclaimed the young girl, hiding her face in her hands. "My <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>! Oh, this is hell!"</p>
<p>"Do you persist in your denial?" demanded the president coldly.</p>
<p>"Do I deny it?" she said with terrible accents; and she rose with flashing eyes.</p>
<p>The president continued squarely,—</p>
<p>"Then how do you explain the facts laid to your charge?"</p>
<p>She replied in a broken voice,—</p>
<p>"I have already told you. I do not know. 'Twas a priest, a priest whom I do not know; an infernal priest who pursues me!"</p>
<p>"That is it," retorted the judge; "the surly monk."</p>
<p>"Oh, gentlemen! have mercy! I am but a poor girl—"</p>
<p>"Of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egypt</span>," said the judge.</p>
<p>Master Jacques Charmolue interposed sweetly,—</p>
<p>"In view of the sad obstinacy of the accused, I demand the application of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Torture" property="schema:name">torture</span>."</p>
<p>"Granted," said the president.</p>
<p>The unhappy girl quivered in every limb. But she rose at the command of the men with partisans, and walked with a tolerably firm step, preceded by Charmolue and the priests of the officiality, between two rows of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Halberd" property="schema:name">halberds</span>, towards a medium-sized door which suddenly opened and closed again behind her, and which produced upon the grief-stricken <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> the effect of a horrible mouth which had just devoured her.</p>
<p>When she disappeared, they heard a plaintive bleating; it was the little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> mourning.</p>
<p>The sitting of the court was suspended. A counsellor having remarked that the gentlemen were fatigued, and that it would be a long time to wait until the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Torture" property="schema:name">torture</span> was at an end, the president replied that a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magistrate" property="schema:name">magistrate</span> must know how to sacrifice himself to his duty.</p>
<p>"What an annoying and vexatious <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slut" property="schema:name">hussy</span>," said an aged judge, "to get herself put to the question when one has not supped!"</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00052">CHAPTER II. CONTINUATION OF THE CROWN WHICH WAS CHANGED INTO A DRY LEAF.</h2>
<p>After ascending and descending several steps in the corridors, which were so dark that they were lighted by lamps at mid-day, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">La Esmeralda</span>, still surrounded by her lugubrious escort, was thrust by the police into a gloomy chamber. This chamber, circular in form, occupied the ground floor of one of those great towers, which, even in our own century, still pierce through the layer of modern edifices with which modern <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> has covered ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. There were no windows to this cellar; no other opening than the entrance, which was low, and closed by an enormous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wrought_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> door. Nevertheless, light was not lacking; a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span> had been constructed in the thickness of the wall; a large fire was lighted there, which filled the vault with its crimson reflections and deprived a miserable candle, which stood in one corner, of all <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radiance" property="schema:name">radiance</span>. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wrought_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> grating which served to close the oven, being raised at that moment, allowed only a view at the mouth of the flaming vent-hole in the dark wall, the lower extremity of its bars, like a row of black and pointed teeth, set flat apart; which made the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span> resemble one of those mouths of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dragon" property="schema:name">dragons</span> which spout forth flames in ancient legends. By the light which escaped from it, the prisoner beheld, all about the room, frightful instruments whose use she did not understand. In the centre lay a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leat" property="schema:name">leat</span>her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mattress" property="schema:name">mattress</span>, placed almost flat upon the ground, over which hung a strap provided with a buckle, attached to a brass ring in the mouth of a flat-nosed monster carved in the keystone of the vault. Tongs, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pincer_(biology)" property="schema:name">pincers</span>, large ploughshares, filled the interior of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span>, and glowed in a confused <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spoil_tip" property="schema:name">heap</span> on the coals. The sanguine light of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span> illuminated in the chamber only a confused mass of horrible things.</p>
<p>This <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tartarus" property="schema:name">Tartarus</span> was called simply, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Question_(comics)" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">The Question</span> Chamber.</p>
<p>On the bed, in a negligent attitude, sat Pierrat Torterue, the official torturer. His underlings, two <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gnome" property="schema:name">gnomes</span> with square faces, leather aprons, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linen" property="schema:name">linen</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breeches" property="schema:name">breeches</span>, were moving the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cast_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> instruments on the coals.</p>
<p>In vain did the poor girl summon up her courage; on entering this chamber she was stricken with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horror_film" property="schema:name">horror</span>.</p>
<p>The sergeants of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> of the courts drew up in line on one side, the priests of the officiality on the other. A clerk, inkhorn, and a table were in one corner.</p>
<p>Master Jacques Charmolue approached the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> with a very sweet smile.</p>
<p>"My dear child," said he, "do you still persist in your denial?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she replied, in a dying voice.</p>
<p>"In that case," replied Charmolue, "it will be very painful for us to have to question you more urgently than we should like. Pray take the trouble to seat yourself on this bed. Master Pierrat, make room for mademoiselle, and close the door."</p>
<p>Pierrat rose with a growl.</p>
<p>"If I shut the door," he muttered, "my fire will go out."</p>
<p>"Well, my dear fellow," replied Charmolue, "leave it open then."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span> had remained standing. That leather bed on which so many unhappy wretches had writhed, frightened her. Terror chilled the very marrow of her bones; she stood there bewildered and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stupefied" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">stupefied</span>. At a sign from Charmolue, the two assistants took her and placed her in a sitting posture on the bed. They did her no harm; but when these men touched her, when that leather touched her, she felt all her blood retreat to her heart. She cast a frightened look around the chamber. It seemed to her as though she beheld advancing from all quarters towards her, with the intention of crawling up her body and biting and pinching her, all those hideous implements of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Torture" property="schema:name">torture</span>, which as compared to the instruments of all sorts she had hitherto seen, were like what bats, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Centipede" property="schema:name">centipedes</span>, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider" property="schema:name">spiders</span> are among <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Insect" property="schema:name">insects</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">birds</span>.</p>
<p>"Where is the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span>?" asked Charmolue.</p>
<p>"Here," replied a black gown whom she had not before noticed.</p>
<p>She shuddered.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle," resumed the caressing voice of the procucrator of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ecclesiastical_court" property="schema:name">Ecclesiastical court</span>, "for the third time, do you persist in denying the deeds of which you are accused?"</p>
<p>This time she could only make a sign with her head.</p>
<p>"You persist?" said Jacques Charmolue. "Then it grieves me deeply, but I must fulfil my office."</p>
<p>"Monsieur le Procureur du Roi," said Pierrat abruptly, "How shall we begin?"</p>
<p>Charmolue hesitated for a moment with the ambiguous grimace of a poet in search of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nursery_rhyme" property="schema:name">rhyme</span>.</p>
<p>"With the boot," he said at last.</p>
<p>The unfortunate girl felt herself so utterly abandoned by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> and men, that her head fell upon her breast like an inert thing which has no power in itself.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tormentor_(musician)" property="schema:name">tormentor</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span> approached her simultaneously. At the same time, the two assistants began to fumble among their hideous arsenal.</p>
<p>At the clanking of their frightful irons, the unhappy child quivered like a dead <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frog" property="schema:name">frog</span> which is being <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galvanization" property="schema:name">galvanized</span>. "Oh!" she <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathy_voice" property="schema:name">murmured</span>, so low that no one heard her; "Oh, my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>!" Then she fell back once more into her immobility and her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> silence. This spectacle would have rent any other heart than those of her judges. One would have pronounced her a poor sinful <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, being tortured by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Devil" property="schema:name">Satan</span> beneath the scarlet wicket of hell. The miserable body which that frightful swarm of saws, wheels, and racks were about to clasp in their clutches, the being who was about to be manipulated by the harsh hands of executioners and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claw" property="schema:name">pincers</span>, was that gentle, white, fragile creature, a poor grain of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millet" property="schema:name">millet</span> which human justice was handing over to the terrible mills of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Torture" property="schema:name">torture</span> to grind. Meanwhile, the callous hands of Pierrat Torterue's assistants had bared that charming leg, that tiny foot, which had so often amazed the passers-by with their delicacy and beauty, in the squares of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>.</p>
<p>"'Tis a shame!" muttered the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tormentor_(musician)" property="schema:name">tormentor</span>, glancing at these graceful and delicate forms.</p>
<p>Had the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> been present, he certainly would have recalled at that moment his symbol of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider" property="schema:name">spider</span> and the fly. Soon the unfortunate girl, through a mist which spread before her eyes, beheld the boot approach; she soon beheld her foot encased between <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> plates disappear in the frightful apparatus. Then terror restored her strength.</p>
<p>"Take that off!" she cried angrily; and drawing herself up, with her hair all dishevelled: "Mercy!"</p>
<p>She darted from the bed to fling herself at the feet of the king's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public_procurator" property="schema:name">procurator</span>, but her leg was fast in the heavy block of oak and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span>, and she sank down upon the boot, more crushed than a bee with a lump of lead on its wing.</p>
<p>At a sign from Charmolue, she was replaced on the bed, and two coarse hands adjusted to her delicate waist the strap which hung from the ceiling.</p>
<p>"For the last time, do you confess the facts in the case?" demanded Charmolue, with his imperturbable benignity.</p>
<p>"I am innocent."</p>
<p>"Then, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miss" property="schema:name">mademoiselle</span>, how do you explain the circumstance laid to your charge?"</p>
<p>"Alas, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monsignor" property="schema:name">monseigneur</span>, I do not know."</p>
<p>"So you deny them?"</p>
<p>"All!"</p>
<p>"Proceed," said Charmolue to Pierrat.</p>
<p>Pierrat turned the handle of the screw-jack, the boot was contracted, and the unhappy girl uttered one of those horrible cries which have no <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orthography" property="schema:name">orthography</span> in any human language.</p>
<p>"Stop!" said Charmolue to Pierrat. "Do you confess?" he said to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>.</p>
<p>"All!" cried the wretched girl. "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Confess_(film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">I confess</span>! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Confess_(film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">I confess</span>! Mercy!"</p>
<p>She had not calculated her strength when she faced the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Torture" property="schema:name">torture</span>. Poor child, whose life up to that time had been so joyous, so pleasant, so sweet, the first pain had conquered her!</p>
<p>"Humanity forces me to tell you," remarked the king's procurator, "that in confessing, it is death that you must expect."</p>
<p>"I certainly hope so!" said she. And she fell back upon the leather bed, dying, doubled up, allowing herself to hang suspended from the strap buckled round her waist.</p>
<p>"Come, fair one, hold up a little," said Master Pierrat, raising her. "You have the air of the lamb of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Golden_Fleece" property="schema:name">Golden Fleece</span> which hangs from Monsieur de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burgundy" typeof="schema:AdministrativeArea" property="schema:name">Bourgogne</span>'s neck."</p>
<p>Jacques Charmolue raised his voice,</p>
<p>"Clerk, write. Young <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemian" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span> maid, you confess your participation in the feasts, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witches'_Sabbath" property="schema:name">witches' sabbaths</span>, and witchcrafts of hell, with ghosts, hags, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vampire" property="schema:name">vampires</span>? Answer."</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, so low that her words were lost in her breathing.</p>
<p>"You confess to having seen the ram which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beelzebub" property="schema:name">Beelzebub</span> causes to appear in the clouds to call together the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witches'_Sabbath" property="schema:name">witches' sabbath</span>, and which is beheld by socerers alone?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You confess to having adored the heads of Bophomet, those abominable idols of the Templars?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"To having had habitual dealings with the devil under the form of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> familiar, joined with you in the suit?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Lastly, you avow and confess to having, with the aid of the demon, and of the phantom vulgarly known as the surly monk, on the night of the twenty-ninth of March last, murdered and assassinated a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> named <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> de Châteaupers?"</p>
<p>She raised her large, staring eyes to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magistrate" property="schema:name">magistrate</span>, and replied, as though mechanically, without convulsion or agitation,—</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>It was evident that everything within her was broken.</p>
<p>"Write, clerk," said Charmolue. And, addressing the torturers, "Release the prisoner, and take her back to the court."</p>
<p>When the prisoner had been "unbooted," the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public_procurator" property="schema:name">procurator</span> of the ecclesiastical court examined her foot, which was still swollen with pain. "Come," said he, "there's no great harm done. You shrieked in good season. You could still dance, my beauty!"</p>
<p>Then he turned to his acolytes of the officiality,—"Behold justice enlightened at last! This is a solace, gentlemen! Madamoiselle will <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bear" property="schema:name">bear</span> us witness that we have acted with all possible gentleness."</p>
