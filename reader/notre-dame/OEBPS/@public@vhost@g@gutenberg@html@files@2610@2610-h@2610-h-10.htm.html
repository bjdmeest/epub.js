<h2 id="pgepubid00038">CHAPTER IV. A TEAR FOR A DROP OF WATER.</h2>
<p>These words were, so to speak, the point of union of two scenes, which had, up to that time, been developed in parallel lines at the same moment, each on its particular <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theatre" property="schema:name">theatre</span>; one, that which the reader has just perused, in the Rat-Hole; the other, which he is about to read, on the ladder of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>. The first had for witnesses only the three women with whom the reader has just made acquaintance; the second had for spectators all the public which we have seen above, collecting on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Place_de_l'Hôtel-de-Ville" property="schema:name">Place de Grève</span>, around the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span>.</p>
<p>That crowd which the four sergeants posted at nine o'clock in the morning at the four corners of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span> had inspired with the hope of some sort of an execution, no doubt, not a hanging, but a whipping, a cropping of ears, something, in short,—that crowd had increased so rapidly that the four policemen, too closely besieged, had had occasion to "press" it, as the expression then ran, more than once, by sound blows of their whips, and the haunches of their horses.</p>
<p>This populace, disciplined to waiting for public executions, did not manifest very much impatience. It amused itself with watching the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>, a very simple sort of monument, composed of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cube" property="schema:name">cube</span> of masonry about six feet high and hollow in the interior. A very steep staircase, of unhewn stone, which was called by distinction "the ladder," led to the upper platform, upon which was visible a horizontal wheel of solid oak. The victim was bound upon this wheel, on his knees, with his hands behind his back. A wooden shaft, which set in motion a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capstan_(nautical)" property="schema:name">capstan</span> concealed in the interior of the little edifice, imparted a rotatory motion to the wheel, which always maintained its horizontal position, and in this manner presented the face of the condemned man to all quarters of the square in succession. This was what was called "turning" a criminal.</p>
<p>As the reader perceives, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span> of the Grève was far from presenting all the recreations of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span> of the Halles. Nothing architectural, nothing monumental. No roof to the iron cross, no octagonal lantern, no frail, slender columns spreading out on the edge of the roof into capitals of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acanthus_(ornament)" property="schema:name">acanthus</span> leaves and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flower" property="schema:name">flowers</span>, no <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gargoyle" property="schema:name">waterspouts</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gargoyle" property="schema:name">chimeras</span> and monsters, on carved woodwork, no fine sculpture, deeply sunk in the stone.</p>
<p>They were forced to content themselves with those four stretches of rubble work, backed with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sandstone" property="schema:name">sandstone</span>, and a wretched stone <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span>, meagre and bare, on one side.</p>
<p>The entertainment would have been but a poor one for lovers of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> architecture. It is true that nothing was ever less curious on the score of architecture than the worthy gapers of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span>, and that they cared very little for the beauty of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>.</p>
<p>The victim finally arrived, bound to the tail of a cart, and when he had been hoisted upon the platform, where he could be seen from all points of the Place, bound with cords and straps upon the wheel of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>, a prodigious <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoot_(film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">hoot</span>, mingled with laughter and acclamations, burst forth upon the Place. They had recognized <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>.</p>
<p>It was he, in fact. The change was singular. Pilloried on the very place where, on the day before, he had been saluted, acclaimed, and proclaimed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span> and Prince of Fools, in the cortege of the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egypt</span>, the King of Thunes, and the Emperor of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galilee" property="schema:name">Galilee</span>! One thing is certain, and that is, that there was not a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> in the crowd, not even himself, though in turn triumphant and the sufferer, who set forth this combination clearly in his thought. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> and his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosophy</span> were missing at this spectacle.</p>
<p>Soon Michel <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philippe_Noiret" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Noiret</span>, sworn <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trumpet" property="schema:name">trumpeter</span> to the king, our lord, imposed silence on the louts, and proclaimed the sentence, in accordance with the order and command of monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(religion)" property="schema:name">provost</span>. Then he withdrew behind the cart, with his men in livery <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surcoat" property="schema:name">surcoats</span>.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, impassible, did not wince. All resistance had been rendered impossible to him by what was then called, in the style of the criminal chancellery, "the vehemence and firmness of the bonds" which means that the thongs and chains probably cut into his flesh; moreover, it is a tradition of jail and wardens, which has not been lost, and which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Handcuffs" property="schema:name">handcuffs</span> still preciously preserve among us, a civilized, gentle, humane people (the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galley" property="schema:name">galleys</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guillotine" property="schema:name">guillotine</span> in parentheses).</p>
<p>He had allowed himself to be led, pushed, carried, lifted, bound, and bound again. Nothing was to be seen upon his countenance but the astonishment of a savage or an idiot. He was known to be <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>; one might have pronounced him to be blind.</p>
<p>They placed him on his knees on the circular plank; he made no resistance. They removed his shirt and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doublet_(clothing)" property="schema:name">doublet</span> as far as his girdle; he allowed them to have their way. They entangled him under a fresh system of thongs and buckles; he allowed them to bind and buckle him. Only from time to time he snorted noisily, like a calf whose head is hanging and bumping over the edge of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Butcher" property="schema:name">butcher</span>'s cart.</p>
<p>"The dolt," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Jehan Frollo</span> of the Mill, to his friend Robin Poussepain (for the two students had followed the culprit, as was to have been expected), "he understands no more than a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cockchafer" property="schema:name">cockchafer</span> shut up in a box!"</p>
<p>There was wild laughter among the crowd when they beheld <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>'s hump, his camel's breast, his callous and hairy shoulders laid bare. During this gayety, a man in the livery of the city, short of stature and robust of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yao_people" property="schema:name">mien</span>, mounted the platform and placed himself near the victim. His name speedily circulated among the spectators. It was Master Pierrat Torterue, official torturer to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Châtelet</span>.</p>
<p>He began by depositing on an angle of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span> a black hour-glass, the upper lobe of which was filled with red sand, which it allowed to glide into the lower receptacle; then he removed his parti-colo<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> surtout, and there became visible, suspended from his right hand, a thin and tapering <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Whip" property="schema:name">whip</span> of long, white, shining, knotted, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Braid" property="schema:name">plaited</span> thongs, armed with metal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nail_(fastener)" property="schema:name">nails</span>. With his left hand, he negligently folded back his shirt around his right arm, to the very armpit.</p>
<p>In the meantime, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Jehan Frollo</span>, elevating his curly blonde head above the crowd (he had mounted upon the shoulders of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tim_Drake" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Robin</span> Poussepain for the purpose), shouted: "Come and look, gentle ladies and men! they are going to peremptorily <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flagellation" property="schema:name">flagellate</span> Master <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> of my brother, monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> of Josas, a knave of oriental architecture, who has a back like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dome" property="schema:name">dome</span>, and legs like twisted columns!"</p>
<p>And the crowd burst into a laugh, especially the boys and young girls.</p>
<p>At length the torturer stamped his foot. The wheel began to turn. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> wavered beneath his bonds. The amazement which was suddenly depicted upon his deformed face caused the bursts of laughter to redouble around him.</p>
<p>All at once, at the moment when the wheel in its revolution presented to Master Pierrat, the humped back of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, Master Pierrat raised his arm; the fine thongs whistled sharply through the air, like a handful of adders, and fell with fury upon the wretch's shoulders.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> leaped as though awakened with a start. He began to understand. He writhed in his bonds; a violent contraction of surprise and pain distorted the muscles of his face, but he uttered not a single sigh. He merely turned his head backward, to the right, then to the left, balancing it as a bull does who has been stung in the flanks by a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse-fly" property="schema:name">gadfly</span>.</p>
<p>A second blow followed the first, then a third, and another and another, and still others. The wheel did not cease to turn, nor the blows to rain down.</p>
<p>Soon the blood burst forth, and could be seen trickling in a thousand threads down the hunchback's black shoulders; and the slender thongs, in their rotatory motion which rent the air, sprinkled drops of it upon the crowd.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had resumed, to all appearance, his first imperturbability. He had at first tried, in a quiet way and without much outward movement, to break his bonds. His eye had been seen to light up, his muscles to stiffen, his members to concentrate their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span>, and the straps to stretch. The effort was powerful, prodigious, desperate; but the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span>'s seasoned bonds resisted. They cracked, and that was all. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> fell back exhausted. Amazement gave way, on his features, to a sentiment of profound and bitter discouragement. He closed his single eye, allowed his head to droop upon his breast, and feigned death.</p>
<p>From that moment forth, he stirred no more. Nothing could <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span> a movement from him. Neither his blood, which did not cease to flow, nor the blows which redoubled in fury, nor the wrath of the torturer, who grew excited himself and intoxicated with the execution, nor the sound of the horrible thongs, more sharp and whistling than the claws of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scorpion" property="schema:name">scorpions</span>.</p>
<p>At length a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Châtelet</span> clad in black, mounted on a black horse, who had been stationed beside the ladder since the beginning of the execution, extended his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ebony" property="schema:name">ebony</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wand" property="schema:name">wand</span> towards the hour-glass. The torturer stopped. The wheel <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Professional_wrestling_throws" property="schema:name">sto</span>pped. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>'s eye opened slowly.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flagellation" property="schema:name">scourging</span> was finished. Two lackeys of the official torturer bathed the bleeding shoulders of the patient, anointed them with some unguent which immediately closed all the wounds, and threw upon his back a sort of yellow <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vestment" property="schema:name">vestment</span>, in cut like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chasuble" property="schema:name">chasuble</span>. In the meanwhile, Pierrat Torterue allowed the thongs, red and gorged with blood, to drip upon the pavement.</p>
<p>All was not over for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. He had still to undergo that hour of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span> which Master Florian Barbedienne had so judiciously added to the sentence of Messire Robert d'Estouteville; all to the greater glory of the old physiological and psychological play upon words of Jean de Cumène, <i>Surdus absurdus</i>: a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man is absurd.</p>
<p>So the hour-glass was turned over once more, and they left the hunchback fastened to the plank, in order that justice might be accomplished to the very end.</p>
<p>The populace, especially in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span>, is in society what the child is in the family. As long as it remains in its state of primitive ignorance, of moral and intellectual minority, it can be said of it as of the child,—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">   'Tis the pitiless age.<br/></div>
<p>We have already shown that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was generally hated, for more than one good reason, it is true. There was hardly a spectator in that crowd who had not or who did not believe that he had reason to complain of the malevolent hunchback of Notre-Dame. The joy at seeing him appear thus in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span> had been universal; and the harsh punishment which he had just suffered, and the pitiful condition in which it had left him, far from softening the populace had rendered its hatred more malicious by arming it with a touch of mirth.</p>
<p>Hence, the "public prosecution" satisfied, as the bigwigs of the law still express it in their jargon, the turn came of a thousand private vengeances. Here, as in the Grand Hall, the women rendered themselves particularly prominent. All cherished some rancor against him, some for his malice, others for his ugliness. The latter were the most furious.</p>
<p>"Oh! mask of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antichrist" property="schema:name">Antichrist</span>!" said one.</p>
<p>"Rider on a broom handle!" cried another.</p>
<p>"What a fine tragic grimace," howled a third, "and who would make him <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span> of the Fools if to-day were yesterday?"</p>
<p>"'Tis well," struck in an old woman. "This is the grimace of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>. When shall we have that of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span>?"</p>
<p>"When will you be coiffed with your big bell a hundred feet under ground, cursed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span>?"</p>
<p>"But 'tis the devil who rings the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angel_(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer)" property="schema:name">Angelus</span>!"</p>
<p>"Oh! the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man! the one-eyed creature! the hunch-back! the monster!"</p>
<p>"A face to make a woman miscarry better than all the drugs and medicines!"</p>
<p>And the two scholars, Jehan du Moulin, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_(comics)" property="schema:name">Robin</span> Poussepain, sang at the top of their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lung" property="schema:name">lungs</span>, the ancient refrain,—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">   "<i>Une <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deer" property="schema:name">hart</span><br/>   Pour le pendard!<br/>   Un fagot<br/>   Pour le magot</i>!"*<br/></div>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  A rope for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallows" property="schema:name">gallows</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">bird</span>!  A fagot for the ape.<br/></div>
<p>A thousand other insults rained down upon him, and hoots and imprecations, and laughter, and now and then, stones.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> but his sight was clear, and the public fury was no less energetically depicted on their visages than in their words. Moreover, the blows from the stones explained the bursts of laughter.</p>
<p>At first he held his ground. But little by little that patience which had borne up under the lash of the torturer, yielded and gave way before all these stings of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Insect" property="schema:name">insects</span>. The bull of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asturias" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Asturias</span> who has been but little moved by the attacks of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Picador" property="schema:name">picador</span> grows irritated with the dogs and banderilleras.</p>
<p>He first cast around a slow glance of hatred upon the crowd. But bound as he was, his glance was powerless to drive away those flies which were stinging his wound. Then he moved in his bonds, and his furious exertions made the ancient wheel of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span> shriek on its axle. All this only increased the derision and hooting.</p>
<p>Then the wretched man, unable to break his collar, like that of a chained wild beast, became tranquil once more; only at intervals a sigh of rage heaved the hollows of his chest. There was neither shame nor redness on his face. He was too far from the state of society, and too near the state of nature to know what shame was. Moreover, with such a degree of deformity, is infamy a thing that can be felt? But wrath, hatred, despair, slowly lowered over that hideous visage a cloud which grew ever more and more sombre, ever more and more charged with electricity, which burst forth in a thousand <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lightning" property="schema:name">lightning</span> flashes from the eye of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyclops" property="schema:name">cyclops</span>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, that cloud cleared away for a moment, at the passage of a mule which traversed the crowd, bearing a priest. As far away as he could see that mule and that priest, the poor victim's visage grew gentler. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_characters_in_the_Metal_Gear_series" property="schema:name">The fury</span> which had contracted it was followed by a strange smile full of ineffable sweetness, gentleness, and tenderness. In proportion as the priest approached, that smile became more clear, more distinct, more radiant. It was like the arrival of a Saviour, which the unhappy man was greeting. But as soon as the mule was near enough to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span> to allow of its rider recognizing the victim, the priest dropped his eyes, beat a hasty retreat, spurred on rigorously, as though in haste to rid himself of humiliating appeals, and not at all desirous of being saluted and recognized by a poor fellow in such a predicament.</p>
<p>This priest was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">Archdeacon</span> Dom <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>.</p>
<p>The cloud descended more blackly than ever upon <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>'s brow. The smile was still mingled with it for a time, but was bitter, discouraged, profoundly sad.</p>
<p>Time passed on. He had been there at least an hour and a half, lacerated, maltreated, mocked incessantly, and almost stoned.</p>
<p>All at once he moved again in his chains with redoubled despair, which made the whole framework that bore him tremble, and, breaking the silence which he had obstinately preserved hitherto, he cried in a hoarse and furious voice, which resembled a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bark" property="schema:name">bark</span> rather than a human cry, and which was drowned in the noise of the hoots—"Drink!"</p>
<p>This exclamation of distress, far from exciting compassion, only added amusement to the good Parisian populace who surrounded the ladder, and who, it must be confessed, taken in the mass and as a multitude, was then no less cruel and brutal than that horrible tribe of robbers among whom we have already conducted the reader, and which was simply the lower stratum of the populace. Not a voice was raised around the unhappy victim, except to jeer at his thirst. It is certain that at that moment he was more grotesque and repulsive than pitiable, with his face purple and dripping, his eye wild, his mouth foaming with rage and pain, and his tongue lolling half out. It must also be stated that if a charitable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> of a bourgeois or <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span>e</i>, in the rabble, had attempted to carry a glass of water to that wretched creature in torment, there reigned around the infamous steps of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span> such a prejudice of shame and ignominy, that it would have sufficed to repulse the good <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan" property="schema:name">Samaritan</span>.</p>
<p>At the expiration of a few moments, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> cast a desperate glance upon the crowd, and repeated in a voice still more heartrending: "Drink!"</p>
<p>And all began to laugh.</p>
<p>"Drink this!" cried <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Hood" property="schema:name">Robin</span> Poussepain, throwing in his face a sponge which had been soaked in the gutter. "There, you <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> villain, I'm your debtor."</p>
<p>A woman hurled a stone at his head,—</p>
<p>"That will teach you to wake us up at night with your <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ring_of_bells" property="schema:name">peal</span> of a dammed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>."</p>
<p>"He, good, my son!" howled a cripple, making an effort to reach him with his crutch, "will you cast any more spells on us from the top of the towers of Notre-Dame?"</p>
<p>"Here's a drinking cup!" chimed in a man, flinging a broken <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Libation" property="schema:name">jug</span> at his breast. "'Twas you that made my wife, simply because she passed near you, give birth to a child with two heads!"</p>
<p>"And my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" property="schema:name">cat</span> bring forth a kitten with six paws!" yelped an old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hag" property="schema:name">crone</span>, launching a brick at him.</p>
<p>"Drink!" repeated <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> panting, and for the third time.</p>
<p>At that moment he beheld the crowd give way. A young girl, fantastically dressed, emerged from the throng. She was accompanied by a little white <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> with gilded horns, and carried a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span> in her hand.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>'s eyes sparkled. It was the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> whom he had attempted to carry off on the preceding night, a misdeed for which he was dimly conscious that he was being punished at that very moment; which was not in the least the case, since he was being chastised only for the misfortune of being <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>, and of having been judged by a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man. He doubted not that she had come to wreak her vengeance also, and to deal her blow like the rest.</p>
<p>He beheld her, in fact, mount the ladder rapidly. Wrath and spite suffocate him. He would have liked to make the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span> crumble into ruins, and if the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lightning" property="schema:name">lightning</span> of his eye could have dealt death, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> would have been reduced to powder before she reached the platform.</p>
<p>She approached, without uttering a syllable, the victim who writhed in a vain effort to escape her, and detaching a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gourd" property="schema:name">gourd</span> from her girdle, she raised it gently to the parched lips of the miserable man.</p>
<p>Then, from that eye which had been, up to that moment, so dry and burning, a big tear was seen to fall, and roll slowly down that deformed visage so long contracted with despair. It was the first, in all <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Probability" property="schema:name">probability</span>, that the unfortunate man had ever shed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he had forgotten to drink. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> made her little pout, from impatience, and pressed the spout to the tusked month of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, with a smile.</p>
<p>He drank with deep <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Draughts" property="schema:name">draughts</span>. His thirst was burning.</p>
<p>When he had finished, the wretch protruded his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Lips" property="schema:name">black lips</span>, no doubt, with the object of kissing the beautiful hand which had just succoured him. But the young girl, who was, perhaps, somewhat distrustful, and who remembered the violent attempt of the night, withdrew her hand with the frightened gesture of a child who is afraid of being bitten by a beast.</p>
<p>Then the poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man fixed on her a look full of reproach and inexpressible sadness.</p>
<p>It would have been a touching spectacle anywhere,—this beautiful, fresh, pure, and charming girl, who was at the same time so weak, thus hastening to the relief of so much misery, deformity, and malevolence. On the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>, the spectacle was sublime.</p>
<p>The very populace were captivated by it, and began to clap their hands, crying,—</p>
<p>"Noel! Noel!"</p>
<p>It was at that moment that the recluse caught sight, from the window of her bole, of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>, and hurled at her her sinister imprecation,—</p>
<p>"Accursed be thou, daughter of Egypt! Accursed! accursed!"</p>

<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">La Esmeralda</span> turned pale and descended from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>, staggering as she went. The voice of the recluse still pursued her,—</p>
<p>"Descend! descend! Thief of Egypt! thou shalt ascend it once more!"</p>
<p>"The sacked <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nun" property="schema:name">nun</span> is in one of her tantrums," muttered the populace; and that was the end of it.

<p>The hour had arrived for removing <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. He was unbound, the crowd dispersed.</p>

<p>"Mother," said the child, "while you were talking with that lady in the bole, a big <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">dog</span> took a bite of my cake, and then I bit it also."</p>
<p>"What, sir, did you eat the whole of it?" she went on.</p>
<p>"Mother, it was the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">dog</span>. I told him, but he would not listen to me. Then I bit into it, also."</p>
<p>"'Tis a terrible child!" said the mother, smiling and scolding at one and the same time. "Do you see, Oudarde? He already eats all the fruit from the cherry-tree in our orchard of Charlerange. So his grandfather says that he will be a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>. Just let me catch you at it again, Master Eustache.

<h2 id="pgepubid00042">CHAPTER I. THE DANGER OF CONFIDING ONE'S SECRET TO A GOAT.</h2>
<p>Many weeks had elapsed.</p>
<p>The first of March had arrived. The sun, which Dubartas, that classic ancestor of periphrase, had not yet dubbed the "Grand-duke of Candles," was none the less radiant and joyous on that account. It was one of those spring days which possesses so much sweetness and beauty, that all <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> turns out into the squares and promenades and celebrates them as though they were Sundays. In those days of brilliancy, warmth, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serenity_(film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">serenity</span>, there is a certain hour above all others, when the façade of Notre-Dame should be admired. It is the moment when the sun, already declining towards the west, looks the cathedral almost full in the face. Its rays, growing more and more horizontal, withdraw slowly from the pavement of the square, and mount up the perpendicular façade, whose thousand bosses in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Relief" property="schema:name">high relief</span> they cause to start out from the shadows, while the great central <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rose_window" property="schema:name">rose window</span> flames like the eye of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyclops" property="schema:name">cyclops</span>, inflamed with the reflections of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hearth" property="schema:name">forge</span>.</p>
<p>This was the hour.</p>
<p>Opposite the lofty cathedral, reddened by the setting sun, on the stone balcony built above the porch of a rich Gothic house, which formed the angle of the square and the Rue du Parvis, several young girls were laughing and chatting with every sort of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_grace" property="schema:name">grace</span> and mirth. From the length of the veil which fell from their pointed coif, twined with pearls, to their heels, from the fineness of the embroidered chemisette which covered their shoulders and allowed a glimpse, according to the pleasing custom of the time, of the swell of their fair virgin bosoms, from the opulence of their under-petticoats still more precious than their overdress (marvellous refinement), from the gauze, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silk" property="schema:name">silk</span>, the velvet, with which all this was composed, and, above all, from the whiteness of their hands, which certified to their leisure and idleness, it was easy to divine they were noble and wealthy heiresses. They were, in fact, Damoiselle <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> de Gondelaurier and her companions, Diane de Christeuil, Amelotte de Montmichel, Colombe de Gaillefontaine, and the little de Champchevrier maiden; all damsels of good birth, assembled at that moment at the house of the dame widow de Gondelaurier, on account of Monseigneur de Beaujeu and Madame his wife, who were to come to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> in the month of April, there to choose maids of honor for the Dauphiness Marguerite, who was to be received in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Picardy" typeof="schema:AdministrativeArea" property="schema:name">Picardy</span> from the hands of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemings</span>. Now, all the squires for twenty leagues around were intriguing for this favor for their daughters, and a goodly number of the latter had been already brought or sent to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. These four maidens had been confided to the discreet and venerable charge of Madame Aloise de Gondelaurier, widow of a former commander of the king's cross-bowmen, who had retired with her only daughter to her house in the Place du Parvis, Notre-Dame, in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>.</p>
<p>The balcony on which these young girls stood opened from a chamber richly tapestried in fawn-colored <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flanders</span> leather, stamped with golden foliage. The beams, which cut the ceiling in parallel lines, diverted the eye with a thousand eccentric painted and gilded carvings. Splendid <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vitreous_enamel" property="schema:name">enamels</span> gleamed here and there on carved chests; a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wild_boar" property="schema:name">boar</span>'s head in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tin-glazing" property="schema:name">faience</span> crowned a magnificent dresser, whose two shelves announced that the mistress of the house was the wife or widow of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Knight_banneret" property="schema:name">knight banneret</span>. At the end of the room, by the side of a lofty chimney <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heraldry" property="schema:name">blazoned</span> with arms from top to bottom, in a rich <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> velvet arm-chair, sat Dame de Gondelaurier, whose five and fifty years were written upon her garments no less distinctly than upon her face.</p>
<p>Beside her stood a young man of imposing <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yao_people" property="schema:name">mien</span>, although partaking somewhat of vanity and bravado—one of those handsome fellows whom all women agree to admire, although grave men learned in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physiognomy" property="schema:name">physiognomy</span> shrug their shoulders at them. This young man wore the garb of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> of the king's unattached archers, which bears far too much resemblance to the costume of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>, which the reader has already been enabled to admire in the first book of this history, for us to inflict upon him a second description.</p>
<p>The damoiselles were seated, a part in the chamber, a part in the balcony, some on square cushions of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Utrecht" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Utrecht</span> velvet with golden corners, others on stools of oak carved in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flower" property="schema:name">flowers</span> and figures. Each of them held on her knee a section of a great <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Needlework" property="schema:name">needlework</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tapestry" property="schema:name">tapestry</span>, on which they were working in company, while one end of it lay upon the rush mat which covered the floor.</p>
<p>They were chatting together in that whispering tone and with the half-stifled laughs peculiar to an assembly of young girls in whose midst there is a young man. The young man whose presence served to set in play all these feminine self-conceits, appeared to pay very little heed to the matter, and, while these pretty damsels were vying with one another to attract his attention, he seemed to be chiefly absorbed in polishing the buckle of his sword belt with his doeskin glove. From time to time, the old lady addressed him in a very low tone, and he replied as well as he was able, with a sort of awkward and constrained politeness.</p>
<p>From the smiles and significant gestures of Dame Aloise, from the glances which she threw towards her daughter, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, as she spoke low to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>, it was easy to see that there was here a question of some betrothal concluded, some marriage near at hand no doubt, between the young man and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>. From the embarrassed coldness of the officer, it was easy to see that on his side, at least, love had no longer any part in the matter. His whole air was expressive of constraint and weariness, which our lieutenants of the garrison would to-day translate admirably as, "What a beastly bore!"</p>
<p>The poor dame, very much infatuated with her daughter, like any other silly mother, did not perceive the officer's lack of enthusiasm, and strove in low tones to call his attention to the infinite <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_grace" property="schema:name">grace</span> with which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> used her needle or wound her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hank_(textile)" property="schema:name">skein</span>.</p>
<p>"Come, little cousin," she said to him, plucking him by the sleeve, in order to speak in his ear, "Look at her, do! see her stoop."</p>
<p>"Yes, truly," replied the young man, and fell back into his glacial and absent-minded silence.</p>
<p>A moment later, he was obliged to bend down again, and Dame Aloise said to him,—</p>
<p>"Have you ever beheld a more <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homosexuality" property="schema:name">gay</span> and charming face than that of your betrothed? Can one be more white and blonde? are not her hands perfect? and that neck—does it not assume all the curves of the swan in ravishing fashion? How I envy you at times! and how happy you are to be a man, naughty libertine that you are! Is not my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> adorably beautiful, and are you not desperately in love with her?"</p>
<p>"Of course," he replied, still thinking of something else.</p>
<p>"But do say something," said Madame Aloise, suddenly giving his shoulder a push; "you have grown very timid."</p>
<p>We can assure our readers that timidity was neither the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>'s virtue nor his defect. But he made an effort to do what was demanded of him.</p>
<p>"Fair cousin," he said, approaching <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, "what is the subject of this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tapestry" property="schema:name">tapestry</span> work which you are fashioning?" "Fair cousin," responded <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, in an offended tone, "I have already told you three times. 'Tis the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grotto" property="schema:name">grotto</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neptune_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Neptune</span>."</p>
<p>It was evident that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> saw much more clearly than her mother through the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>'s cold and absent-minded manner. He felt the necessity of making some conversation.</p>
<p>"And for whom is this Neptunerie destined?"</p>
<p>"For the Abbey of Saint-Antoine des Champs," answered <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, without raising her eyes.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> took up a corner of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tapestry" property="schema:name">tapestry</span>.</p>
<p>"Who, my fair cousin, is this big <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gendarmerie" property="schema:name">gendarme</span>, who is puffing out his cheeks to their full extent and blowing a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trumpet" property="schema:name">trumpet</span>?"</p>
<p>"'Tis <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triton_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Triton</span>," she replied.</p>
<p>There was a rath<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/ER_(TV_series)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">er</span> pettish <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intonation_(linguistics)" property="schema:name">intonation</span> in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>'s—laconic words. The young man understood that it was indispensable that he should whisper something in her ear, a commonplace, a gallant compliment, no matter what. Accordingly he bent down, but he could find nothing in his imagination more tender and personal than this,—</p>
<p>"Why does your mother always wear that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surcoat" property="schema:name">surcoat</span> with armorial designs, like our grandmothers of the time of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_VII_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles VII</span>.? Tell her, fair cousin, that 'tis no longer the fashion, and that the hinge (<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gondi_people" property="schema:name">gond</span>) and the laurel (<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilfrid_Laurier" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">laurier</span>) embroidered on her robe give her the air of a walking mantlepiece. In truth, people no longer sit thus on their banners, I assure you."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> raised her beautiful eyes, full of reproach, "Is that all of which you can assure me?" she said, in a low voice.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Dame Aloise, delighted to see them thus bending towards each other and whispering, said as she toyed with the clasps of her prayer-book,—</p>
<p>"Touching picture of love!"</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(United_States)" property="schema:name">captain</span>, more and more embarrassed, fell back upon the subject of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tapestry" property="schema:name">tapestry</span>,—"'Tis, in sooth, a charming work!" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Whereupon Colombe de Gaillefontaine, another beautiful blonde, with a white skin, dressed to the neck in blue <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Damask" property="schema:name">damask</span>, ventured a timid remark which she addressed to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, in the hope that the handsome <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(United_States)" property="schema:name">captain</span> would reply to it, "My dear Gondelaurier, have you seen the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tapestry" property="schema:name">tapestries</span> of the Hôtel de la Roche-Guyon?"</p>
<p>"Is not that the hotel in which is enclosed the garden of the Lingère du <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Louvre" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Louvre</span>?" asked Diane de Christeuil with a laugh; for she had handsome teeth, and consequently laughed on every occasion.</p>
<p>"And where there is that big, old tower of the ancient wall of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>," added Amelotte de Montmichel, a pretty fresh and curly-headed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brown_hair" property="schema:name">brunette</span>, who had a habit of sighing just as the other laughed, without knowing why.</p>
<p>"My dear Colombe," interpolated Dame Aloise, "do you not mean the hotel which belonged to Monsieur de Bacqueville, in the reign of King <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_VI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles VI</span>.? there are indeed many superb high warp <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tapestry" property="schema:name">tapestries</span> there."</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_VI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles VI</span>.! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_VI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles VI</span>.!" muttered the young <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>, twirling his moustache. "Good heavens! what old things the good dame does remember!"</p>
<p>Madame de Gondelaurier continued, "Fine <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tapestry" property="schema:name">tapestries</span>, in truth. A work so esteemed that it passes as unrivalled."</p>
<p>At that moment Bérangère de Champchevrier, a slender little maid of seven years, who was peering into the square through the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trefoil" property="schema:name">trefoils</span> of the balcony, exclaimed, "Oh! look, fair Godmother <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, at that pretty dancer who is dancing on the pavement and playing the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span> in the midst of the loutish <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span>!"</p>
<p>The sonorous vibration of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span> was, in fact, audible. "Some <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bohemia</span>," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, turning carelessly toward the square.</p>
<p>"Look! look!" exclaimed her lively companions; and they all ran to the edge of the balcony, while <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, rendered thoughtful by the coldness of her betrothed, followed them slowly, and the latter, relieved by this incident, which put an end to an embarrassing conversation, retreated to the farther end of the room, with the satisfied air of a soldier released from duty. Nevertheless, the fair <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>'s was a charming and noble service, and such it had formerly appeared to him; but the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span> had gradually become blase'; the prospect of a speedy marriage cooled him more every day. Moreover, he was of a fickle disposition, and, must we say it, rather vulgar in taste. Although of very noble birth, he had contracted in his official harness more than one habit of the common trooper. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tavern" property="schema:name">tavern</span> and its accompaniments pleased him. He was only at his ease amid gross language, military gallantries, facile beauties, and successes yet more easy. He had, nevertheless, received from his family some education and some politeness of manner; but he had been thrown on the world too young, he had been in garrison at too early an age, and every day the polish of a gentleman became more and more effaced by the rough friction of his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gendarmerie" property="schema:name">gendarme</span>'s cross-belt. While still continuing to visit her from time to time, from a remnant of common respect, he felt doubly embarrassed with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>; in the first place, because, in consequence of having scattered his love in all sorts of places, he had reserved very little for her; in the next place, because, amid so many stiff, formal, and decent ladies, he was in constant fear lest his mouth, habituated to oaths, should suddenly take the bit in its teeth, and break out into the language of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tavern" property="schema:name">tavern</span>. The effect can be imagined!</p>
<p>Moreover, all this was mingled in him, with great pretentions to elegance, toilet, and a fine appearance. Let the reader reconcile these things as best he can. I am simply the historian.</p>
<p>He had remained, therefore, for several minutes, leaning in silence against the carved jamb of the chimney, and thinking or not thinking, when <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> suddenly turned and addressed him. After all, the poor young girl was pouting against the dictates of her heart.</p>
<p>"Fair cousin, did you not speak to us of a little Bohemian whom you saved a couple of months ago, while making the patrol with the watch at night, from the hands of a dozen robbers?"</p>
<p>"I believe so, fair cousin," said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>.</p>
<p>"Well," she resumed, "perchance 'tis that same <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> girl who is dancing yonder, on the church square. Come and see if you recognize her, fair Cousin <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>."</p>
<p>A secret desire for reconciliation was apparent in this gentle invitation which she gave him to approach her, and in the care which she took to call him by name. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_Phoebus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Captain Phoebus</span> de Châteaupers (for it is he whom the reader has had before his eyes since the beginning of this chapter) slowly approached the balcony. "Stay," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, laying her hand tenderly on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>'s arm; "look at that little girl yonder, dancing in that circle. Is she your Bohemian?"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> looked, and said,—</p>
<p>"Yes, I recognize her by her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scapegoat" property="schema:name">goat</span>."</p>
<p>"Oh! in fact, what a pretty little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>!" said Amelotte, clasping her hands in admiration.</p>
<p>"Are his horns of real gold?" inquired Bérangère.</p>
<p>Without moving from her arm-chair, Dame Aloise interposed, "Is she not one of those <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> girls who arrived last year by the Gibard gate?"</p>
<p>"Madame my mother," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> gently, "that gate is now called the Porte d'Enfer."</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Gondelaurier knew how her mother's antiquated mode of speech shocked the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>. In fact, he began to sneer, and muttered between his teeth: "Porte Gibard! Porte Gibard! 'Tis enough to make King <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_VI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles VI</span>. pass by."</p>
<p>"Godmother!" exclaimed Bérangère, whose eyes, incessantly in motion, had suddenly been raised to the summit of the towers of Notre-Dame, "who is that black man up yonder?"</p>
<p>All the young girls raised their eyes. A man was, in truth, leaning on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span> which surmounted the northern tower, looking on the Grève. He was a priest. His costume could be plainly discerned, and his face resting on both his hands. But he stirred no more than if he had been a statue. His eyes, intently fixed, gazed into the Place.</p>
<p>It was something like the immobility of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">bird</span> of prey, who has just discovered a nest of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparrow" property="schema:name">sparrows</span>, and is gazing at it.</p>
<p>"'Tis monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> of Josas," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>.</p>
<p>"You have good eyes if you can recognize him from here," said the Gaillefontaine.</p>
<p>"How he is staring at the little dancer!" went on Diane de Christeuil.</p>
<p>"Let the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> beware!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, "for he loves not <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egypt</span>."</p>
<p>"'Tis a great shame for that man to look upon her thus," added Amelotte de Montmichel, "for she dances delightfully."</p>
<p>"Fair cousin <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> suddenly, "Since you know this little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, make her a sign to come up here. It will amuse us."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes!" exclaimed all the young girls, clapping their hands.</p>
<p>"Why! 'tis not worth while," replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>. "She has forgotten me, no doubt, and I know not so much as her name. Nevertheless, as you wish it, young ladies, I will make the trial." And leaning over the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span> of the balcony, he began to shout, "Little one!"</p>
<p>The dancer was not beating her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span> at the moment. She turned her head towards the point whence this call proceeded, her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strategic_Defense_Initiative" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">brilliant eyes</span> rested on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, and she stopped short.</p>
<p>"Little one!" repeated the captain; and he beckoned her to approach.</p>
<p>The young girl looked at him again, then she blushed as though a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fireworks" property="schema:name">flame</span> had mounted into her cheeks, and, taking her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span> under her arm, she made her way through the astonished spectators towards the door of the house where <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> was calling her, with slow, tottering steps, and with the troubled look of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">bird</span> which is yielding to the fascination of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Snake" property="schema:name">serpent</span>.</p>
<p>A moment later, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tapestry" property="schema:name">tapestry</span> portière was raised, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> appeared on the threshold of the chamber, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blushing" property="schema:name">blushing</span>, confused, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathless_(1960_film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">breathless</span>, her large eyes drooping, and not daring to advance another step.</p>
<p>Bérangère clapped her hands.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the dancer remained motionless upon the threshold. Her appearance had produced a singular effect upon these young girls. It is certain that a vague and indistinct desire to please the handsome officer animated them all, that his splendid uniform was the target of all their coquetries, and that from the moment he presented himself, there existed among them a secret, suppressed rivalry, which they hardly acknowledged even to themselves, but which broke forth, none the less, every instant, in their gestures and remarks. Nevertheless, as they were all very nearly equal in beauty, they contended with equal arms, and each could hope for the victory.—The arrival of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> suddenly destroyed this equilibrium. Her beauty was so rare, that, at the moment when she appeared at the entrance of the apartment, it seemed as though she diffused a sort of light which was peculiar to herself. In that narrow chamber, surrounded by that sombre frame of hangings and woodwork, she was incomparably more beautiful and more radiant than on the public square. She was like a torch which has suddenly been brought from broad daylight into the dark. The noble damsels were dazzled by her in spite of themselves. Each one felt herself, in some sort, wounded in her beauty. Hence, their battle front (may we be allowed the expression,) was immediately altered, although they exchanged not a single word. But they understood each other perfectly. Women's instincts comprehend and respond to each other more quickly than the intelligences of men. An <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exame_Nacional_do_Ensino_Médio" property="schema:name">enem</span>y had just arrived; all felt it—all rallied together. One drop of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span> is sufficient to tinge a glass of water <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red_hair" property="schema:name">red</span>; to diffuse a certain degree of ill temper throughout a whole assembly of pretty women, the arrival of a prettier woman suffices, especially when there is but one man present.</p>
<p>Hence the welcome accorded to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> was marvellously glacial. They surveyed her from head to foot, then exchanged glances, and all was said; they understood each other. Meanwhile, the young girl was waiting to be spoken to, in such emotion that she dared not raise her eyelids.</p>
<p>The captain was the first to break the silence. "Upon my word," said he, in his tone of intrepid fatuity, "here is a charming creature! What think you of her, fair cousin?"</p>
<p>This remark, which a more delicate admirer would have uttered in a lower tone, at least was not of a nature to dissipate the feminine jealousies which were on the alert before the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> replied to the captain with a bland affectation of disdain;—"Not bad."</p>
<p>The others whispered.</p>
<p>At length, Madame Aloise, who was not the less jealous because she was so for her daughter, addressed the dancer,—"Approach, little one."</p>
<p>"Approach, little one!" repeated, with comical dignity, little Bérangère, who would have reached about as high as her hips.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> advanced towards the noble dame.</p>
<p>"Fair child," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, with emphasis, taking several steps towards her, "I do not know whether I have the supreme honor of being recognized by you."</p>
<p>She interrupted him, with a smile and a look full of infinite sweetness,—</p>
<p>"Oh! yes," said she.</p>
<p>"She has a good <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span>," remarked <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>.</p>
<p>"Come, now," resumed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, "you escaped nimbly the other evening. Did I frighten you!"</p>
<p>"Oh! no," said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>.</p>
<p>There was in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intonation_(linguistics)" property="schema:name">intonation</span> of that "Oh! no," uttered after that "Oh! yes," an ineffable something which wounded <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>.</p>
<p>"You left me in your stead, my beauty," pursued the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>, whose tongue was unloosed when speaking to a girl out of the street, "a crabbed knave, one-eyed and hunchbacked, the bishop's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span>, I believe. I have been told that by birth he is the bastard of an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> and a devil. He has a pleasant name: he is called <i>Quatre-Temps</i> (<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ember_days" property="schema:name">Ember Days</span>), <i>Paques-Fleuries</i> (<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palm_Sunday" property="schema:name">Palm Sunday</span>), <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mardi_Gras" property="schema:name">Mardi-Gras</span> (<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shrove_Tuesday" property="schema:name">Shrove Tuesday</span>), I know not what! The name of some festival when the bells are pealed! So he took the liberty of carrying you off, as though you were made for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beadle" property="schema:name">beadles</span>! 'Tis too much. What the devil did that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Screech_owl" property="schema:name">screech-owl</span> want with you? Hey, tell me!"</p>
<p>"I do not know," she replied.</p>
<p>"The inconceivable impudence! A <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> carrying off a wench, like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viscount" property="schema:name">vicomte</span>! a lout <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poaching" property="schema:name">poaching</span> on the game of gentlemen! that is a rare piece of assurance. However, he paid dearly for it. Master Pierrat Torterue is the harshest groom that ever curried a knave; and I can tell you, if it will be agreeable to you, that your <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span>'s hide got a thorough dressing at his hands."</p>
<p>"Poor man!" said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, in whom these words revived the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span> burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"Corne-de-boeuf! here's pity as well placed as a feather in a pig's tail! May I have as big a belly as a pope, if—"</p>
<p>He stopped short. "Pardon me, ladies; I believe that I was on the point of saying something foolish."</p>
<p>"Fie, sir" said la Gaillefontaine.</p>
<p>"He talks to that creature in her own tongue!" added <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, in a low tone, her irritation increasing every moment. This irritation was not diminished when she beheld the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>, enchanted with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/False_hero" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, and, most of all, with himself, execute a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glossary_of_ballet" property="schema:name">pirouette</span> on his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heel_(professional_wrestling)" property="schema:name">heel</span>, repeating with coarse, naïve, and soldierly gallantry,—</p>
<p>"A handsome wench, upon my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>!"</p>
<p>"Rather savagely dressed," said Diane de Christeuil, laughing to show her fine teeth.</p>
<p>This remark was a flash of light to the others. Not being able to impugn her beauty, they attacked her costume.</p>
<p>"That is true," said la Montmichel; "what makes you run about the streets thus, without guimpe or ruff?"</p>
<p>"That petticoat is so short that it makes one tremble," added la Gaillefontaine.</p>
<p>"My dear," continued <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, with decided sharpness, "You will get yourself taken up by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sumptuary_law" property="schema:name">sumptuary</span> police for your gilded girdle."</p>
<p>"Little one, little one;" resumed la Christeuil, with an implacable smile, "if you were to put respectable sleeves upon your arms they would get less sunburned."</p>
<p>It was, in truth, a spectacle worthy of a more intelligent spectator than <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, to see how these beauti<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ful_medames" property="schema:name">ful</span> maidens, with their envenomed and angry tongues, wound, serpent-like, and glided and writhed around the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Street_dance" property="schema:name">street dancer</span>. They were cruel and graceful; they searched and rummaged maliciously in her poor and silly toilet of spangles and tinsel. There was no end to their laughter, irony, and humiliation. Sarcasms rained down upon the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, and haughty condescension and malevolent looks. One would have thought they were young Roman dames thrusting golden pins into the breast of a beautiful slave. One would have pronounced them elegant grayhounds, circling, with inflated nostrils, round a poor woodland fawn, whom the glance of their master forbade them to devour.</p>
<p>After all, what was a miserable dancer on the public squares in the presence of these high-born maidens? They seemed to take no heed of her presence, and talked of her aloud, to her face, as of something unclean, abject, and yet, at the same time, passably pretty.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> was not insensible to these pin-pricks. From time to time a flush of shame, a flash of anger inflamed her eyes or her cheeks; with disdain she made that little grimace with which the reader is already familiar, but she remained motionless; she fixed on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> a sad, sweet, resigned look. There was also <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Happiness" property="schema:name">happiness</span> and tenderness in that gaze. One would have said that she endured for fear of being expelled.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> laughed, and took the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s part with a mixture of impertinence and pity.</p>
<p>"Let them talk, little one!" he repeated, jingling his golden spurs. "No doubt your toilet is a little extravagant and wild, but what difference does that make with such a charming damsel as yourself?"</p>
<p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed the blonde Gaillefontaine, drawing up her swan-like throat, with a bitter smile. "I see that messieurs the archers of the king's police easily take fire at the handsome eyes of gypsies!"</p>
<p>"Why not?" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>.</p>
<p>At this reply uttered carelessly by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span>, like a stray stone, whose fall one does not even watch, Colombe began to laugh, as well as Diane, Amelotte, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, into whose eyes at the same time a tear started.</p>
<p>The gypsy, who had dropped her eyes on the floor at the words of Colombe de Gaillefontaine, raised them beaming with joy and pride and fixed them once more on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>. She was very beautiful at that moment.</p>
<p>The old dame, who was watching this scene, felt offended, without understanding why.</p>
<p>"Holy Virgin!" she suddenly exclaimed, "what is it moving about my legs? Ah! the villanous beast!"</p>
<p>It was the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, who had just arrived, in search of his mistress, and who, in dashing towards the latter, had begun by entangling his horns in the pile of stuffs which the noble dame's garments heaped up on her feet when she was seated.</p>
<p>This created a diversion. The gypsy disentangled his horns without uttering a word.</p>
<p>"Oh! here's the little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> with golden hoofs!" exclaimed Bérangère, dancing with joy.</p>
<p>The gypsy crouched down on her knees and leaned her cheek against the fondling head of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>. One would have said that she was asking pardon for having quitted it thus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Diane had bent down to Colombe's ear.</p>
<p>"Ah! good heavens! why did not I think of that sooner? 'Tis the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>. They say she is a sorceress, and that her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> executes very miraculous tricks."</p>
<p>"Well!" said Colombe, "the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> must now amuse us in its turn, and perform a miracle for us."</p>
<p>Diane and Colombe eagerly addressed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>.</p>
<p>"Little one, make your <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> perform a miracle."</p>
<p>"I do not know what you mean," replied the dancer.</p>
<p>"A miracle, a piece of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span>, a bit of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">sorcery</span>, in short."</p>
<p>"I do not understand." And she fell to caressing the pretty animal, repeating, "Djali! Djali!"</p>
<p>At that moment <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> noticed a little bag of embroidered leather suspended from the neck of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>,—"What is that?" she asked of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> raised her large eyes upon her and replied gravely,—"That is my secret."</p>
<p>"I should really like to know what your secret is," thought <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the good dame had risen angrily,—"Come now, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, if neither you nor your <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> can dance for us, what are you doing here?"</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> walked slowly towards the door, without making any reply. But the nearer she approached it, the more her pace slackened. An irresistible magnet seemed to hold her. Suddenly she turned her eyes, wet with tears, towards <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>, and halted.</p>
<p>"True <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>!" exclaimed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>, "that's not the way to depart. Come back and dance something for us. By the way, my sweet love, what is your name?"</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">La Esmeralda</span>," said the dancer, never taking her eyes from him.</p>
<p>At this strange name, a burst of wild laughter broke from the young girls.</p>
<p>"Here's a terrible name for a young lady," said Diane.</p>
<p>"You see well enough," retorted Amelotte, "that she is an enchantress."</p>
<p>"My dear," exclaimed Dame Aloise solemnly, "your parents did not commit the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sin" property="schema:name">sin</span> of giving you that name at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baptism" property="schema:name">baptismal font</span>."</p>
<p>In the meantime, several minutes previously, Bérangère had coaxed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> into a corner of the room with a marchpane cake, without any one having noticed her. In an instant they had become good friends. The curious child had detached the bag from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>'s neck, had opened it, and had emptied out its contents on the rush matting; it was an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alphabet" property="schema:name">alphabet</span>, each letter of which was separately inscribed on a tiny block of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buxus" property="schema:name">boxwood</span>. Hardly had these playthings been spread out on the matting, when the child, with surprise, beheld the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> (one of whose "miracles" this was no doubt), draw out certain letters with its golden <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoof" property="schema:name">hoof</span>, and arrange them, with gentle pushes, in a certain order. In a moment they constituted a word, which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> seemed to have been trained to write, so little hesitation did it show in forming it, and Bérangère suddenly exclaimed, clasping her hands in admiration,—</p>
<p>"Godmother <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, see what the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> has just done!"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> ran up and trembled. The letters arranged upon the floor formed this word,—</p></body></html>
