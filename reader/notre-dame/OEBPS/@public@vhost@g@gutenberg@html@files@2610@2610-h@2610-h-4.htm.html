<h2 id="pgepubid00020">CHAPTER VII. A BRIDAL NIGHT.</h2>
<p>A few moments later our poet found himself in a tiny arched chamber, very cosy, very warm, seated at a table which appeared to ask nothing better than to make some loans from a larder hanging near by, having a good bed in prospect, and alone with a pretty girl. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adventure_game" property="schema:name">adventure</span> smacked of enchantment. He began seriously to take himself for a personage in a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fairy_tale" property="schema:name">fairy tale</span>; he cast his eyes about him from time to time to time, as though to see if the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chariot" property="schema:name">chariot</span> of fire, harnessed to two-winged <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chimera_(mythology)" property="schema:name">chimeras</span>, which alone could have so rapidly transported him from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tartarus" property="schema:name">Tartarus</span> to Paradise, were still there. At times, also, he fixed his eyes obstinately upon the holes in his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doublet_(clothing)" property="schema:name">doublet</span>, in order to cling to reality, and not lose the ground from under his feet completely. His reason, tossed about in imaginary space, now hung only by this thread.</p>
<p>The young girl did not appear to pay any attention to him; she went and came, displaced a stool, talked to her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, and indulged in a pout now and then. At last she came and seated herself near the table, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> was able to scrutinize her at his ease.</p>
<p>You have been a child, reader, and you would, perhaps, be very happy to be one still. It is quite certain that you have not, more than once (and for my part, I have passed whole days, the best employed of my life, at it) followed from thicket to thicket, by the side of running water, on a sunny day, a beautiful green or blue dragon-fly, breaking its flight in abrupt angles, and kissing the tips of all the branches. You recollect with what amorous curiosity your thought and your gaze were riveted upon this little whirlwind, hissing and humming with wings of purple and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tincture_(heraldry)" property="schema:name">azure</span>, in the midst of which floated an imperceptible body, veiled by the very rapidity of its movement. The aerial being which was dimly outlined amid this quivering of wings, appeared to you chimerical, imaginary, impossible to touch, impossible to see. But when, at length, the dragon-fly alighted on the tip of a reed, and, holding your breath the while, you were able to examine the long, gauze wings, the long <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vitreous_enamel" property="schema:name">enamel</span> robe, the two <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Globe" property="schema:name">globes</span> of crystal, what astonishment you felt, and what fear lest you should again behold the form disappear into a shade, and the creature into a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chimera_(mythology)" property="schema:name">chimera</span>! Recall these impressions, and you will readily appreciate what <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> felt on contemplating, beneath her visible and palpable form, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">Esmeralda</span> of whom, up to that time, he had only caught a glimpse, amidst a whirlwind of dance, song, and tumult.</p>
<p>Sinking deeper and deeper into his revery: "So this," he said to himself, following her vaguely with his eyes, "is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span>! a celestial creature! a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Street_dance" property="schema:name">street dancer</span>! so much, and so little! 'Twas she who dealt the death-blow to my mystery this morning, 'tis she who <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Save_(baseball)" property="schema:name">saves</span> my life this evening! My evil genius! My good angel! A <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pretty_Woman" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">pretty woman</span>, on my word! and who must needs love me madly to have taken me in that fashion. By the way," said he, rising suddenly, with that sentiment of the true which formed the foundation of his character and his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosophy</span>, "I don't know very well how it happens, but I am her husband!"</p>
<p>With this idea in his head and in his eyes, he stepped up to the young girl in a manner so military and so gallant that she drew back.</p>
<p>"What do you want of me?" said she.</p>
<p>"Can you ask me, adorable Esmeralda?" replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, with so passionate an accent that he was himself astonished at it on hearing himself speak.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> opened her great eyes. "I don't know what you mean."</p>
<p>"What!" resumed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, growing warmer and warmer, and supposing that, after all, he had to deal merely with a virtue of the Cour des Miracles; "am I not thine, sweet friend, art thou not mine?"</p>
<p>And, quite ingenuously, he clasped her waist.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s corsage slipped through his hands like the skin of an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eel" property="schema:name">eel</span>. She bounded from one end of the tiny room to the other, stooped down, and raised herself again, with a little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poignard" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">poniard</span> in her hand, before <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> had even had time to see whence the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poignard" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">poniard</span> came; proud and angry, with swelling lips and inflated nostrils, her cheeks as <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> as an api apple,* and her eyes darting lightnings. At the same time, the white <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> placed itself in front of her, and presented to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> a hostile front, bristling with two pretty horns, gilded and very sharp. All this took place in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  A small <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dessert" property="schema:name">dessert</span> apple, bright <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> on one side and<br/>     greenish-white on the other.<br/></div>
<p>The dragon-f<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Light-year" property="schema:name">ly</span> had turned into a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wasp" property="schema:name">wasp</span>, and asked nothing better than to sting.</p>
<p>Our <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span> was speechless, and turned his astonished eyes from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> to the young girl. "Holy Virgin!" he said at last, when surprise permitted him to speak, "here are two hearty dames!"</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> broke the silence on her side.</p>
<p>"You must be a very bold knave!"</p>
<p>"Pardon, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miss" property="schema:name">mademoiselle</span>," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, with a smile. "But why did you take me for your husband?"</p>
<p>"Should I have allowed you to be hanged?"</p>
<p>"So," said the poet, somewhat disappointed in his amorous hopes. "You had no other idea in marrying me than to save me from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span>?"</p>
<p>"And what other idea did you suppose that I had?"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> bit his lips. "Come," said he, "I am not yet so triumphant in Cupido, as I thought. But then, what was the good of breaking that poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Libation" property="schema:name">jug</span>?"</p>
<p>Meanwhile <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Esméralda_(The_Hunchback_of_Notre-Dame)" property="schema:name">Esmeralda</span>'s <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dagger" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">dagger</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>'s horns were still upon the defensive.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Esméralda_(The_Hunchback_of_Notre-Dame)" property="schema:name">Esmeralda</span>," said the poet, "let us come to terms. I am not a clerk of the court, and I shall not go to law with you for thus carrying a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dagger" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">dagger</span> in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, in the teeth of the ordinances and prohibitions of M. the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">Provost</span>. Nevertheless, you are not ignorant of the fact that Noel Lescrivain was condemned, a week ago, to pay ten Parisian sous, for having carried a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sword" property="schema:name">cutlass</span>. But this is no affair of mine, and I will come to the point. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Swear" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">I swear</span> to you, upon my share of Paradise, not to approach you without your leave and permission, but do give me some supper."</p>
<p>The truth is, Gringoire was, like M. Despreaux, "not very voluptuous." He did not belong to that chevalier and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musket" property="schema:name">musketeer</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Species" property="schema:name">species</span>, who take young girls by assault. In the matter of love, as in all other affairs, he willingly assented to temporizing and adjusting terms; and a good supper, and an amiable tête-a-tête appeared to him, especially when he was hungry, an excellent interlude between the prologue and the catastrophe of a love <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adventure_game" property="schema:name">adventure</span>.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> did not reply. She made her disdainful little grimace, drew up her head like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">bird</span>, then burst out laughing, and the tiny <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poignard" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">poniard</span> disappeared as it had come, without <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> being able to see where the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wasp" property="schema:name">wasp</span> concealed its sting.</p>
<p>A moment later, there stood upon the table a loaf of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rye_bread" property="schema:name">rye bread</span>, a slice of bacon, some wrinkled apples and a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Libation" property="schema:name">jug</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beer" property="schema:name">beer</span>. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> began to eat eagerly. One would have said, to hear the furious clashing of his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fork" property="schema:name">fork</span> and his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earthenware" property="schema:name">earthenware</span> plate, that all his love had turned to appetite.</p>
<p>The young girl seated opposite him, watched him in silence, visibly preoccupied with another thought, at which she smiled from time to time, while her soft hand caressed the intelligent head of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, gently pressed between her knees.</p>
<p>A candle of yellow <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wax" property="schema:name">wax</span> illuminated this scene of voracity and revery.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the first cravings of his stomach having been stilled, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> felt some false shame at perceiving that nothing remained but one apple.</p>
<p>"You do not eat, Mademoiselle Esmeralda?"</p>
<p>She replied by a negative sign of the head, and her pensive glance fixed itself upon the vault of the ceiling.</p>
<p>"What the deuce is she thinking of?" thought <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, staring at what she was gazing at; "'tis impossible that it can be that stone <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dwarf_(Germanic_mythology)" property="schema:name">dwarf</span> carved in the keystone of that arch, which thus absorbs her attention. What the deuce! I can <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bear" property="schema:name">bear</span> the comparison!"</p>
<p>He raised his voice, "Mademoiselle!"</p>
<p>She seemed not to hear him.</p>
<p>He repeated, still more loudly, "Mademoiselle <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Esméralda_(The_Hunchback_of_Notre-Dame)" property="schema:name">Esmeralda</span>!"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trouble_(band)" property="schema:name">Trouble</span> wasted. The young girl's mind was elsewhere, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>'s voice had not the power to recall it. Fortunately, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> interfered. She began to pull her mistress gently by the sleeve.</p>
<p>"What dost thou want, Djali?" said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, hastily, as though suddenly awakened.</p>
<p>"She is hungry," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, charmed to enter into conversation. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Esméralda_(The_Hunchback_of_Notre-Dame)" property="schema:name">Esmeralda</span> began to crumble some bread, which Djali ate gracefully from the hollow of her hand.</p>
<p>Moreover, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> did not give her time to resume her revery. He hazarded a delicate question.</p>
<p>"So you don't want me for your husband?"</p>
<p>The young girl looked at him intently, and said, "No."</p>
<p>"For your lover?" went on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p>She pouted, and replied, "No."</p>
<p>"For your friend?" pursued <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p>She gazed fixedly at him again, and said, after a momentary reflection, "Perhaps."</p>
<p>This "perhaps," so dear to philosophers, emboldened <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p>"Do you know what friendship is?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>; "it is to be brother and sister; two souls which touch without mingling, two fingers on one hand."</p>
<p>"And love?" pursued <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p>"Oh! love!" said she, and her voice trembled, and her eye beamed. "That is to be two and to be but one. A man and a woman mingled into one angel. It is heaven."</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Street_performance" property="schema:name">street dancer</span> had a beauty as she spoke thus, that struck <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> singularly, and seemed to him in perfect keeping with the almost oriental <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exaltation_(Mormonism)" property="schema:name">exaltation</span> of her words. Her pure, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> lips half smiled; her serene and candid brow became troubled, at intervals, under her thoughts, like a mirror under the breath; and from beneath her long, drooping, black <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eyelash" property="schema:name">eyelashes</span>, there escaped a sort of ineffable light, which gave to her profile that ideal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serenity_(film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">serenity</span> which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raphael" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Raphael</span> found at the mystic point of intersection of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Virginity" property="schema:name">virginity</span>, maternity, and divinity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> continued,—</p>
<p>"What must one be then, in order to please you?"</p>
<p>"A man."</p>
<p>"And I—" said he, "what, then, am I?"</p>
<p>"A man has a hemlet on his head, a sword in his hand, and golden spurs on his heels."</p>
<p>"Good," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "without a horse, no man. Do you love any one?"</p>
<p>"As a lover?—"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>She remained thoughtful for a moment, then said with a peculiar expression: "That I shall know soon."</p>
<p>"Why not this evening?" resumed the poet tenderly. "Why not me?"</p>
<p>She cast a grave glance upon him and said,—</p>
<p>"I can never love a man who cannot protect me."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> colored, and took the hint. It was evident that the young girl was alluding to the slight assistance which he had rendered her in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Composers_Recordings,_Inc." property="schema:name">cri</span><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thai_baht" property="schema:name">tical</span> situation in which she had found herself two hours previously. This <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span>, effaced by his own adventures of the evening, now recurred to him. He smote his brow.</p>
<p>"By the way, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miss" property="schema:name">mademoiselle</span>, I ought to have begun there. Pardon my foolish absence of mind. How did you contrive to escape from the claws of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>?"</p>
<p>This question made the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> shudder.</p>
<p>"Oh! the horrible hunchback," said she, hiding her face in her hands. And she shuddered as though with violent cold.</p>
<p>"Horrible, in truth," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, who clung to his idea; "but how did you manage to escape him?"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">La Esmeralda</span> smiled, sighed, and remained <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span>.</p>
<p>"Do you know why he followed you?" began <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> again, seeking to return to his question by a circuitous route.</p>
<p>"I don't know," said the young girl, and she added hastily, "but you were following me also, why were you following me?"</p>
<p>"In good faith," responded <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "I don't know either."</p>
<p>Silence ensued. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> slashed the table with his knife. The young girl smiled and seemed to be gazing through the wall at something. All at once she began to sing in a barely articulate voice,—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">   <i>Quando las pintadas aves,<br/>   Mudas estan, y la tierra</i>—*<br/></div>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  When the gay-plumaged <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">birds</span> grow weary, and the earth—<br/></div>
<p>She broke off abruptly, and began to caress Djali.</p>
<p>"That's a pretty animal of yours," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p>"She is my sister," she answered.</p>
<p>"Why are you called '<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span>?'" asked the poet.</p>
<p>"I do not know."</p>
<p>"But why?"</p>
<p>She drew from her bosom a sort of little oblong bag, suspended from her neck by a string of adrézarach beads. This bag exhaled a strong odor of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Camphor" property="schema:name">camphor</span>. It was covered with green <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silk" property="schema:name">silk</span>, and bore in its centre a large piece of green glass, in imitation of an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emerald" property="schema:name">emerald</span>.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is because of this," said she.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> was on the point of taking the bag in his hand. She drew back.</p>
<p>"Don't touch it! It is an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amulet" property="schema:name">amulet</span>. You would injure the charm or the charm would injure you."</p>
<p>The poet's curiosity was more and more aroused.</p>
<p>"Who gave it to you?"</p>
<p>She laid one finger on her mouth and concealed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amulet" property="schema:name">amulet</span> in her bosom. He tried a few more questions, but she hardly replied.</p>
<p>"What is the meaning of the words, '<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span>?'"</p>
<p>"I don't know," said she.</p>
<p>"To what language do they belong?"</p>
<p>"They are <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egyptian</span>, I think."</p>
<p>"I suspected as much," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "you are not a native of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"Are your parents alive?"</p>
<p>She began to sing, to an ancient air,—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced"> <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mon_people" property="schema:name">Mon</span> père est oiseau,<br/>  Ma mère est oiselle.<br/>  Je passe l'eau sans <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nacelle" property="schema:name">nacelle</span>,<br/>  Je passe l'eau sans <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bateau" property="schema:name">bateau</span>,<br/>  Ma mère est oiselle,<br/>  <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mon_people" property="schema:name">Mon</span> père est oiseau</i>.*<br/></div>

<p>"Good," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>. "At what age did you come to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>?"</p>
<p>"When I was very young."</p>
<p>"And when to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>?"</p>
<p>"Last year. At the moment when we were entering the papal gate I saw a reed warbler flit through the air, that was at the end of August; I said, it will be a hard winter."</p>
<p>"So it was," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, delighted at this beginning of a conversation. "I passed it in blowing my fingers. So you have the gift of prophecy?"</p>
<p>She retired into her laconics again.</p>
<p>"Is that man whom you call the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egypt</span>, the chief of your tribe?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"But it was he who married us," remarked the poet timidly.</p>
<p>She made her customary pretty grimace.</p>
<p>"I don't even know your name."</p>
<p>"My name? If you want it, here it is,—<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span>."</p>
<p>"I know a prettier one," said she.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naughty_Girl_(Beyoncé_Knowles_song)" property="schema:name">Naughty girl</span>!" retorted the poet. "Never mind, you shall not provoke me. Wait, perhaps you will love me more when you know me better; and then, you have told me your story with so much confidence, that I owe you a little of mine. You must know, then, that my name is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span>, and that I am a son of the farmer of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Civil_law_notary" property="schema:name">notary</span>'s office of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gonesse" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Gonesse</span>. My father was hung by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burgundians" property="schema:name">Burgundians</span>, and my mother <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disembowelment" property="schema:name">disembowelled</span> by the Picards, at the siege of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, twenty years ago. At six years of age, therefore, I was an orphan, without a sole to my foot except the pavements of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. I do not know how I passed the interval from six to sixteen. A fruit dealer gave me a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plum" property="schema:name">plum</span> here, a baker flung me a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bread" property="schema:name">crust</span> there; in the evening I got myself taken up by the watch, who threw me into prison, and there I found a bundle of straw. All this did not prevent my growing up and growing thin, as you see. In the winter I warmed myself in the sun, under the porch of the Hôtel de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Sens" property="schema:name">Sens</span>, and I thought it very ridiculous that the fire on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_the_Baptist" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint John</span>'s Day was reserved for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog_Days" property="schema:name">dog days</span>. At sixteen, I wished to choose a calling. I tried all in succession. I became a soldier; but I was not brave enough. I became a monk; but I was not sufficiently devout; and then I'm a bad hand at drinking. In despair, I became an apprentice of the woodcutters, but I was not strong enough; I had more of an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yetzer_hara" property="schema:name">inclination</span> to become a schoolmaster; 'tis true that I did not know how to read, but that's no reason. I perceived at the end of a certain time, that I lacked something in every direction; and seeing that I was good for nothing, of my own free will I became a poet and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poetaster" property="schema:name">rhymester</span>. That is a trade which one can always adopt when one is a vagabond, and it's better than stealing, as some young brigands of my acquaintance advised me to do. One day I met by luck, Dom <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>, the reverend <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> of Notre-Dame. He took an interest in me, and it is to him that I to-day owe it that I am a veritable man of letters, who knows <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span> from the <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/De_Officiis" property="schema:name">de Officiis</span></i> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Cicero</span> to the mortuology of the Celestine Fathers, and a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barbarian" property="schema:name">barbarian</span> neither in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scholasticism" property="schema:name">scholastics</span>, nor in politics, nor in rhythmics, that sophism of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sophism" property="schema:name">sophism</span>s. I am the author of the Mystery which was presented to-day with great triumph and a great concourse of populace, in the grand hall of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law_Courts_of_Brussels" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Palais de Justice</span>. I have also made a book which will contain six hundred pages, on the wonderful <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Comet" property="schema:name">comet</span> of 1465, which sent one man mad. I have enjoyed still other successes. Being somewhat of an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artillery" property="schema:name">artillery</span> carpenter, I lent a hand to Jean Mangue's great bombard, which burst, as you know, on the day when it was tested, on the Pont de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charenton-le-Pont" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Charenton</span>, and killed four and twenty curious spectators. You see that I am not a bad match in marriage. I know a great many sorts of very engaging tricks, which I will teach your <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>; for example, to mimic the Bishop of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, that cursed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pharisees" property="schema:name">Pharisee</span> whose mill wheels splash passers-by the whole length of the Pont aux Meuniers. And then my mystery will bring me in a great deal of coined money, if they will only pay me. And finally, I am at your orders, I and my wits, and my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span> and my letters, ready to live with you, damsel, as it shall please you, chastely or joyously; husband and wife, if you see fit; brother and sister, if you think that better."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> ceased, awaiting the effect of his harangue on the young girl. Her eyes were fixed on the ground.</p>
<p>"'<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>,'" she said in a low voice. Then, turning towards the poet, "'<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>',—what does that mean?"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, without exactly understanding what the connection could be between his address and this question, was not sorry to display his erudition. Assuming an air of importance, he replied,—</p>
<p>"It is a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span> word which means 'sun.'"</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sun" property="schema:name">Sun</span>!" she repeated.</p>
<p>"It is the name of a handsome <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archery" property="schema:name">archer</span>, who was a god," added <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p>"A god!" repeated the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, and there was something pensive and passionate in her tone.</p>
<p>At that moment, one of her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bracelet" property="schema:name">bracelets</span> became unfastened and fell. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> stooped quickly to pick it up; when he straightened up, the young girl and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> had disappeared. He heard the sound of a bolt. It was a little door, communicating, no doubt, with a neighboring cell, which was being fastened on the outside.</p>
<p>"Has she left me a bed, at least?" said our <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span>.</p>
<p>He made the tour of his cell. There was no piece of furniture adapted to sleeping purposes, except a tolerably long wooden coffer; and its cover was carved, to boot; which afforded <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, when he stretched himself out upon it, a sensation somewhat similar to that which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Micromégas" property="schema:name">Micromégas</span> would feel if he were to lie down on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alps" property="schema:name">Alps</span>.</p>
<p>"Come!" said he, adjusting himself as well as possible, "I must resign myself. But here's a strange nuptial night. 'Tis a pity. There was something innocent and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flood_myth" property="schema:name">antediluvian</span> about that broken crock, which quite pleased me."</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00022">CHAPTER I. NOTRE-DAME.</h2>
<p>The church of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Notre_Dame_de_Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Notre-Dame de Paris</span> is still no doubt, a majestic and sublime edifice. But, beautiful as it has been preserved in growing old, it is difficult not to sigh, not to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wax" property="schema:name">wax</span> indignant, before the numberless degradations and mutilations which time and men have both caused the venerable monument to suffer, without respect for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charlemagne</span>, who laid its first stone, or for Philip <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Augustus</span>, who laid the last.</p>
<p>On the face of this aged queen of our <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cathedral" property="schema:name">cathedrals</span>, by the side of a wrinkle, one always finds a scar. <i>Tempus edax, homo edacior*</i>; which I should be glad to translate thus: time is blind, man is stupid.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  Time is a devourer; man, more so.<br/></div>
<p>If we had leisure to examine with the reader, one by one, the diverse traces of destruction imprinted upon the old church, time's share would be the least, the share of men the most, especially the men of art, since there have been individuals who assumed the title of architects during the last two centuries.</p>
<p>And, in the first place, to cite only a few leading examples, there certainly are few finer architectural pages than this façade, where, successively and at once, the three portals hollowed out in an arch; the broidered and dentated cordon of the eight and twenty royal niches; the immense central <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rose_window" property="schema:name">rose window</span>, flanked by its two lateral windows, like a priest by his deacon and sub<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">deacon</span>; the frail and lofty gallery of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trefoil" property="schema:name">trefoil</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arcade_(architecture)" property="schema:name">arcades</span>, which supports a heavy platform above its fine, slender columns; and lastly, the two black and massive towers with their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slate" property="schema:name">slate</span> penthouses, harmonious parts of a magnificent whole, superposed in five gigantic stories;—develop themselves before the eye, in a mass and without confusion, with their innumerable details of statuary, carving, and sculpture, joined powerfully to the tranquil grandeur of the whole; a vast symphony in stone, so to speak; the colossal work of one man and one people, all together one and complex, like the Iliads and the Romanceros, whose sister it is; prodigious product of the grouping together of all the forces of an epoch, where, upon each stone, one sees the fancy of the workman disciplined by the genius of the artist start forth in a hundred fashions; a sort of human creation, in a word, powerful and fecund as the divine creation of which it seems to have stolen the double character,—variety, eternity.</p>
<p>And what we here say of the façade must be said of the entire church; and what we say of the cathedral church of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, must be said of all the churches of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christendom" property="schema:name">Christendom</span> in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span>. All things are in place in that art, self-created, logical, and well proportioned. To measure the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toe" property="schema:name">great toe</span> of the foot is to measure the giant.</p>
<p>Let us return to the façade of Notre-Dame, as it still appears to us, when we go piously to admire the grave and puissant cathedral, which inspires terror, so its chronicles assert: <i>quae <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mole_(animal)" property="schema:name">mole</span> sua terrorem incutit spectantibus</i>.</p>
<p>Three important things are to-day lacking in that façade: in the first place, the staircase of eleven steps which formerly raised it above the soil; next, the lower series of statues which occupied the niches of the three portals; and lastly the upper series, of the twenty-eight most ancient kings of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>, which garnished the gallery of the first story, beginning with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Childebert_I" property="schema:name">Childebert</span>, and ending with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Phillip Augustus</span>, holding in his hand "the imperial apple."</p>
<p>Time has caused the staircase to disappear, by raising the soil of the city with a slow and irresistible progress; but, while thus causing the eleven steps <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Women's_Health_Initiative" property="schema:name">whi</span>ch added to the majestic height of the edifice, to be devoured, one by one, by the rising tide of the pavements of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>,—time has bestowed upon the church perhaps more than it has taken away, for it is time which has spread over the façade that sombre <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hue" property="schema:name">hue</span> of the centuries which makes the old age of monuments the period of their beauty.</p>
<p>But who has thrown down the two rows of statues? who has left the niches empty? who has cut, in the very middle of the central portal, that new and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Legitimacy_(law)" property="schema:name">bastard</span> arch? who has dared to frame therein that commonplace and heavy door of carved wood, à la <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rococo" property="schema:name">Louis XV</span>., beside the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabesque_(Islamic_art)" property="schema:name">arabesques</span> of Biscornette? The men, the architects, the artists of our day.</p>
<p>And if we enter the interior of the edifice, who has overthrown that colossus of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Christopher" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint Christopher</span>, proverbial for magnitude among statues, as the grand hall of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Courthouse" property="schema:name">Palais de Justice</span> was among halls, as the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strasbourg_Cathedral" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Strasbourg</span> among spires? And those myriads of statues, which peopled all the spaces between the columns of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nave" property="schema:name">nave</span> and the choir, kneeling, standing, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Equestrian_statue" property="schema:name">equestrian</span>, men, women, children, kings, bishops, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gendarme_(historical)" property="schema:name">gendarmes</span>, in stone, in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span>, in gold, in silver, in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copper" property="schema:name">copper</span>, in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wax" property="schema:name">wax</span> even,—who has brutally swept them away? It is not time.</p>
<p>And who substituted for the ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">gothic</span> altar, splendidly encumbered with shrines and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reliquary" property="schema:name">reliquaries</span>, that heavy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sarcophagus" property="schema:name">sarcophagus</span>, with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angel" property="schema:name">angels</span>' heads and clouds, which seems a specimen pillaged from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Val-de-Grâce" property="schema:name">Val-de-Grâce</span> or the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Les_Invalides" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Invalides</span>? Who stupidly sealed that heavy anachronism of stone in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carolingian_dynasty" property="schema:name">Carlovingian</span> pavement of Hercandus? Was it not <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XIV</span>., fulfilling the request of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIII_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XIII</span>.?</p>
<p>And who put the cold, white panes in the place of those windows, "high in color," which caused the astonished eyes of our fathers to hesitate between the rose of the grand portal and the arches of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apse" property="schema:name">apse</span>? And what would a sub-chanter of the sixteenth century say, on beholding the beautiful yellow wash, with which our archiepiscopal vandals have desmeared their cathedral? He would remember that it was the color with which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hanging" property="schema:name">hangman</span> smeared "accursed" edifices; he would recall the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hôtel_du_Petit-Bourbon" property="schema:name">Hôtel du Petit-Bourbon</span>, all smeared thus, on account of the constable's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treason" property="schema:name">treason</span>. "Yellow, after all, of so good a quality," said Sauval, "and so well recommended, that more than a century has not yet caused it to lose its color." He would think that the sacred place had become infamous, and would flee.</p>
<p>And if we ascend the cathedral, without mentioning a thousand <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barbarian" property="schema:name">barbarisms</span> of every sort,—what has become of that charming little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell tower</span>, which rested upon the point of intersection of the cross-roofs, and which, no less frail and no less bold than its neighbor (also destroyed), the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sainte-Chapelle" property="schema:name">Sainte-Chapelle</span>, buried itself in the sky, farther forward than the towers, slender, pointed, sonorous, carved in open work. An architect of good taste amputated it (1787), and considered it sufficient to mask the wound with that large, leaden plaster, which resembles a pot cover.</p>
<p>'Tis thus that the marvellous art of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span> has been treated in nearly every country, especially in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>. One can distinguish on its ruins three sorts of lesions, all three of which cut into it at different depths; first, time, which has insensibly notched its surface here and there, and gnawed it everywhere; next, political and religious revolution, which, blind and wrathful by nature, have flung themselves tumultuously upon it, torn its rich garment of carving and sculpture, burst its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rose_window" property="schema:name">rose windows</span>, broken its necklace of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabesque_(Islamic_art)" property="schema:name">arabesques</span> and tiny figures, torn out its statues, sometimes because of their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mitre" property="schema:name">mitres</span>, sometimes because of their crowns; lastly, fashions, even more grotesque and foolish, which, since the anarchical and splendid deviations of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance" property="schema:name">Renaissance</span>, have followed each other in the necessary decadence of architecture. Fashions have wrought more harm than revolutions. They have cut to the quick; they have attacked the very <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bone" property="schema:name">bone</span> and framework of art; they have cut, slashed, disorganized, killed the edifice, in form as in the symbol, in its consistency as well as in its beauty. And then they have made it over; a presumption of which neither time nor revolutions at least have been guilty. They have audaciously adjusted, in the name of "good taste," upon the wounds of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_art" property="schema:name">gothic</span> architecture, their miserable gewgaws of a day, their ribbons of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span>, their pompons of metal, a veritable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leprosy" property="schema:name">leprosy</span> of egg-shaped ornaments, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volute" property="schema:name">volutes</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Whorl_(mollusc)" property="schema:name">whorls</span>, draperies, garlands, fringes, stone flames, bronze clouds, pudgy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cupid" property="schema:name">cupids</span>, chubby-cheeked <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cherub" property="schema:name">cherubim</span>, which begin to devour the face of art in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhetoric" property="schema:name">oratory</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catherine_de'_Medici" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Catherine de Medicis</span>, and cause it to expire, two centuries later, tortured and grimacing, in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boudoir" property="schema:name">boudoir</span> of the Dubarry.</p>
<p>Thus, to sum up the points which we have just indicated, three sorts of ravages to-day disfigure <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic architecture</span>. Wrinkles and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wart" property="schema:name">warts</span> on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skin" property="schema:name">epidermis</span>; this is the work of time. Deeds of violence, brutalities, contusions, fractures; this is the work of the revolutions from Luther to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Honoré_Gabriel_Riqueti,_comte_de_Mirabeau" property="schema:name">Mirabeau</span>. Mutilations, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amputation" property="schema:name">amputations</span>, dislocation of the joints, "restorations"; this is the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece" property="schema:name">Greek</span>, Roman, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barbarian" property="schema:name">barbarian</span> work of professors according to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vitruvius" property="schema:name">Vitruvius</span> and Vignole. This magnificent art produced by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vandals" property="schema:name">Vandals</span> has been slain by the academies. The centuries, the revolutions, which at least devastate with impartiality and grandeur, have been joined by a cloud of school architects, licensed, sworn, and bound by oath; defacing with the discernment and choice of bad taste, substituting the <i>chicorées</i> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XV_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XV</span>. for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goths" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lace" property="schema:name">lace</span>, for the greater glory of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parthenon" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Parthenon</span>. It is the kick of the ass at the dying lion. It is the old oak crowning itself, and which, to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory_management" property="schema:name">heap</span> the measure full, is stung, bitten, and gnawed by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caterpillar" property="schema:name">caterpillars</span>.</p>
<p>How far it is from the epoch when Robert Cenalis, comparing <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Notre_Dame_de_Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Notre-Dame de Paris</span> to the famous temple of Diana at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephesus" property="schema:name">Ephesus</span>, *so much lauded by the ancient pagans*, which Erostatus *has* immortalized, found the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaul" property="schema:name">Gallic</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Transmission_electron_microscopy" property="schema:name">tem</span>ple "more excellent in length, breadth, height, and structure."*</p>

<p>Notre-Dame is not, moreover, what can be called a complete, definite, classified monument. It is no longer a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque</span> church; nor is it a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> church. This edifice is not a type. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Notre_Dame_de_Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Notre-Dame de Paris</span> has not, like the Abbey of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tournus" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Tournus</span>, the grave and massive frame, the large and round vault, the glacial bareness, the majestic simplicity of the edifices which have the rounded arch for their progenitor. It is not, like the Cathedral of Bourges, the magnificent, light, multiform, tufted, bristling <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Efflorescence" property="schema:name">efflorescent</span> product of the pointed arch. Impossible to class it in that ancient family of sombre, mysterious churches, low and crushed as it were by the round arch, almost <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egyptian</span>, with the exception of the ceiling; all <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egyptian_hieroglyphs" property="schema:name">hieroglyphics</span>, all <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clergy" property="schema:name">sacerdotal</span>, all symbolical, more loaded in their ornaments, with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lozenge" property="schema:name">lozenges</span> and zigzags, than with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flower" property="schema:name">flowers</span>, with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flower" property="schema:name">flowers</span> than with animals, with animals than with men; the work of the architect less than of the bishop; first transformation of art, all impressed with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theocracy" property="schema:name">theocratic</span> and military discipline, taking root in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantine_Empire" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Lower Empire</span>, and stopping with the time of William the Conqueror. Impossible to place our Cathedral in that other family of lofty, aerial churches, rich in painted windows and sculpture; pointed in form, bold in attitude; communal and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> as political symbols; free, capricious, lawless, as a work of art; second transformation of architecture, no longer <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egyptian_hieroglyphs" property="schema:name">hieroglyphic</span>, immovable and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clergy" property="schema:name">sacerdotal</span>, but artistic, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Progressive_rock" property="schema:name">progressive</span>, and popular, which begins at the return from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crusades" property="schema:name">crusades</span>, and ends with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_IX_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis IX</span>. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Notre_Dame_de_Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Notre-Dame de Paris</span> is not of pure <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque</span>, like the first; nor of pure Arabian race, like the second.</p>
<p>It is an edifice of the transition period. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anglo-Saxon_architecture" property="schema:name">Saxon</span> architect completed the erection of the first pillars of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nave" property="schema:name">nave</span>, when the pointed arch, which dates from the Crusade, arrived and placed itself as a conqueror upon the large <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque</span> capitals which should support only round arches. The pointed arch, mistress since that time, constructed the rest of the church. Nevertheless, timid and inexperienced at the start, it sweeps out, grows larger, restrains itself, and dares no longer dart upwards in spires and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lancet_window" property="schema:name">lancet windows</span>, as it did later on, in so many marvellous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cathedral" property="schema:name">cathedrals</span>. One would say that it were conscious of the vicinity of the heavy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque</span> pillars.</p>
<p>However, these edifices of the transition from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque</span> to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span>, are no less precious for study than the pure types. They express a shade of the art which would be lost without them. It is the graft of the pointed upon the round arch.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Notre_Dame_de_Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Notre-Dame de Paris</span> is, in particular, a curious specimen of this variety. Each face, each stone of the venerable monument, is a page not only of the history of the country, but of the history of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span> and art as well. Thus, in order to indicate here only the principal details, while the little Red Door almost attains to the limits of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> delicacy of the fifteenth century, the pillars of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nave" property="schema:name">nave</span>, by their size and weight, go back to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carolingian_dynasty" property="schema:name">Carlovingian</span> Abbey of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Germain-des-Prés" property="schema:name">Saint-Germain des Prés</span>. One would suppose that six centuries separated these pillars from that door. There is no one, not even the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermeticism" property="schema:name">hermetics</span>, who does not find in the symbols of the grand portal a satisfactory compendium of their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span>, of which the Church of Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie was so complete a hieroglyph. Thus, the Roman abbey, the philosophers' church, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic art</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anglo-Saxons" property="schema:name">Saxon</span> art, the heavy, round pillar, which recalls <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Gregory_VII" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Gregory VII</span>., the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermeticism" property="schema:name">hermetic</span> symbolism, with which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolas_Flamel" property="schema:name">Nicolas Flamel</span> played the prelude to Luther, papal unity, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Schism_(religion)" property="schema:name">schism</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Germain-des-Prés" property="schema:name">Saint-Germain des Prés</span>, Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie,—all are mingled, combined, amalgamated in Notre-Dame. This central <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cathedral" property="schema:name">mother church</span> is, among the ancient churches of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, a sort of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chimera_(mythology)" property="schema:name">chimera</span>; it has the head of one, the limbs of another, the haunches of another, something of all.</p>
<p>We repeat it, these <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hybrid_(biology)" property="schema:name">hybrid</span> constructions are not the least interesting for the artist, for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_antiquity" property="schema:name">antiquarian</span>, for the historian. They make one feel to what a degree architecture is a primitive thing, by demonstrating (what is also demonstrated by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyclops" property="schema:name">cyclopean</span> vestiges, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyramid" property="schema:name">pyramids</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egypt</span>, the gigantic <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindu" property="schema:name">Hindoo</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stupa" property="schema:name">pagodas</span>) that the greatest products of architecture are less the works of individuals than of society; rather the offspring of a nation's effort, than the inspired flash of a man of genius; the deposit left by a whole people; the heaps accumulated by centuries; the residue of successive evaporations of human society,—in a word, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Species" property="schema:name">species</span> of formations. Each wave of time contributes its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alluvium" property="schema:name">alluvium</span>, each race deposits its layer on the monument, each individual brings his stone. Thus do the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beaver" property="schema:name">beavers</span>, thus do the bees, thus do men. The great symbol of architecture, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tower_of_Babel" property="schema:name">Babel</span>, is a hive.</p>
<p>Great edifices, like great mountains, are the work of centuries. Art often undergoes a transformation while they are pending, <i>pendent <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Opera" property="schema:name">opera</span> interrupta</i>; they proceed quietly in accordance with the transformed art. The new art takes the monument where it finds it, incrusts itself there, assimilates it to itself, develops it according to its fancy, and finishes it if it can. The thing is accomplished without trouble, without effort, without reaction,—following a natural and tranquil law. It is a graft which shoots up, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plant_sap" property="schema:name">sap</span> which circulates, a vegetation which starts forth anew. Certainly there is matter here for many large volumes, and often the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Universal_history" property="schema:name">universal history</span> of humanity in the successive engrafting of many arts at many levels, upon the same monument. The man, the artist, the individual, is effaced in these great masses, which lack the name of their author; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intelligence" property="schema:name">human intelligence</span> is there summed up and totalized. Time is the architect, the nation is the builder.</p>
<p>Not to consider here anything except the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christianity" property="schema:name">Christian</span> architecture of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Europe</span>, that younger sister of the great masonries of the Orient, it appears to the eyes as an immense formation divided into three well-defined zones, which are superposed, the one upon the oth<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/ER_(TV_series)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">er</span>: the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romanesque_architecture" property="schema:name">Romanesque</span> zone*, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> zone, the zone of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance" property="schema:name">Renaissance</span>, which we would gladly call the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Roman_architecture" property="schema:name">Greco-Roman</span> zone. The Roman layer, which is the most ancient and deepest, is occupied by the round arch, which reappears, supported by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_order" property="schema:name">Greek column</span>, in the modern and upper layer of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance" property="schema:name">Renaissance</span>. The pointed arch is found between the two. The edifices which belong exclusively to any one of these three layers are perfectly distinct, uniform, and complete. There is the Abbey of Jumiéges, there is the Cathedral of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reims_Cathedral" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Reims</span>, there is the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Croix,_U.S._Virgin_Islands" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Sainte-Croix</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orléans" property="schema:name">Orleans</span>. But the three zones mingle and amalgamate along the edges, like the colors in the solar spectrum. Hence, complex monuments, edifices of gradation and transition. One is Roman at the base, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> in the middle, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Roman_architecture" property="schema:name">Greco-Roman</span> at the top. It is because it was six hundred years in building. This variety is rare. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keep" property="schema:name">donjon</span> keep of d'Etampes is a specimen of it. But monuments of two formations are more frequent. There is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Notre_Dame_de_Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Notre-Dame de Paris</span>, a pointed-arch edifice, which is imbedded by its pillars in that Roman zone, in which are plunged the portal of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basilica_of_St_Denis" property="schema:name">Saint-Denis</span>, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nave" property="schema:name">nave</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Germain-des-Prés" property="schema:name">Saint-Germain des Prés</span>. There is the charming, half-Gothic <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chapter_house" property="schema:name">chapter-house</span> of Bocherville, where the Roman layer extends half way up. There is the cathedral of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rouen" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Rouen</span>, which would be entirely <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> if it did not bathe the tip of its central <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span> in the zone of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance_architecture" property="schema:name">Renaissance</span>.**</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  This is the same which is called, according to locality,<br/>climate, and races, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lombards" property="schema:name">Lombard</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anglo-Saxon_architecture" property="schema:name">Saxon</span>, or <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantine_architecture" property="schema:name">Byzantine</span>. There are four sister<br/>and parallel architectures, each having its special character, but<br/>derived from the same origin, the round arch.<br/><br/>  <i>Facies non omnibus una,<br/>  No diversa tamen, qualem</i>, etc.<br/></div>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">Their faces not all alike, nor yet different, but such as the faces of<br/>sisters ought to be.<br/><br/>     **  This portion of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spire" property="schema:name">spire</span>, which was of woodwork, is precisely<br/>that which was consumed by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lightning" property="schema:name">lightning</span>, in 1823.<br/></div>
<p>However, all these shades, all these differences, do not affect the surfaces of edifices only. It is art which has changed its skin. The very constitution of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christianity" property="schema:name">Christian</span> church is not attacked by it. There is always the same internal woodwork, the same logical arrangement of parts. Whatever may be the carved and embroidered envelope of a cathedral, one always finds beneath it—in the state of a germ, and of a rudiment at the least—the Roman basilica. It is eternally developed upon the soil according to the same law. There are, invariably, two <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nave" property="schema:name">naves</span>, which intersect in a cross, and whose upper portion, rounded into an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apse" property="schema:name">apse</span>, forms the choir; there are always the side <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aisle" property="schema:name">aisles</span>, for interior processions, for chapels,—a sort of lateral <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" property="schema:name">walks</span> or promenades where the principal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nave" property="schema:name">nave</span> discharges itself through the spaces between the pillars. That settled, the number of chapels, doors, bell towers, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pinnacle" property="schema:name">pinnacles</span> are modified to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infinity" property="schema:name">infinity</span>, according to the fancy of the century, the people, and art. The service of religion once assured and provided for, architecture does what she pleases. Statues, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stained_glass" property="schema:name">stained glass</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rose_window" property="schema:name">rose windows</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabesque_(Islamic_art)" property="schema:name">arabesques</span>, denticulations, capitals, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Relief" property="schema:name">bas-reliefs</span>,—she combines all these imaginings according to the arrangement which best suits her. Hence, the prodigious exterior variety of these edifices, at whose foundation dwells so much order and unity. The trunk of a tree is immovable; the foliage is capricious.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00023">CHAPTER II. A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF PARIS.</h2>
<p>We have just attempted to restore, for the reader's benefit, that admirable church of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Notre_Dame_de_Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Notre-Dame de Paris</span>. We have briefly pointed out the greater part of the beauties which it possessed in the fifteenth century, and which it lacks to-day; but we have omitted the principal thing,—the view of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> which was then to be obtained from the summits of its towers.</p>
<p>That was, in fact,—when, after having long groped one's way up the dark spiral which perpendicularly pierces the thick wall of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">belfries</span>, one emerged, at last abruptly, upon one of the lofty platforms inundated with light and air,—that was, in fact, a fine picture which spread out, on all sides at once, before the eye; a spectacle <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sui_generis" property="schema:name">sui generis</span></i>, of which those of our readers who have had the good fortune to see a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> city entire, complete, homogeneous,—a few of which still remain, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuremberg" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Nuremberg</span> in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bavaria" typeof="schema:AdministrativeArea" property="schema:name">Bavaria</span> and Vittoria in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spain" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Spain</span>,—can readily form an idea; or even smaller specimens, provided that they are well preserved,—<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vitré,_Ille-et-Vilaine" property="schema:name">Vitré</span> in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brittany" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Brittany</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nordhausen" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Nordhausen</span> in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Prussia</span>.</p>
<p>The Paris of three hundred and fifty years ago—the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> of the fifteenth century—was already a gigantic city. We <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>ians generally make a mistake as to the ground which we think that we have gained, since <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> has not increased much over one-third since the time of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. It has certainly lost more in beauty than it has gained in size.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> had its birth, as the reader knows, in that old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Island" property="schema:name">island</span> of the City which has the form of a cradle. The strand of that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Island" property="schema:name">island</span> was its first boundary wall, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span> its first <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moat" property="schema:name">moat</span>. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> remained for many centuries in its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Island" property="schema:name">island</span> state, with two bridges, one on the north, the other on the south; and two bridge heads, which were at the same time its gates and its fortresses,—the Grand-Châtelet on the right <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank_(geography)" property="schema:name">bank</span>, the Petit-Châtelet on the left. Then, from the date of the kings of the first race, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, being too cribbed and confined in its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Island" property="schema:name">island</span>, and unable to return thither, crossed the water. Then, beyond the Grand, beyond the Petit-Châtelet, a first circle of walls and towers began to infringe upon the country on the two sides of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>. Some vestiges of this ancient enclosure still remained in the last century; to-day, only the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span> of it is left, and here and there a tradition, the Baudets or Baudoyer gate, "Porte Bagauda".</p>
<p>Little by little, the tide of houses, always thrust from the heart of the city outw<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ards_(borough)" property="schema:name">ards</span>, overflows, devours, wears away, and effaces this wall. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Philip Augustus</span> makes a new <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Levee" property="schema:name">dike</span> for it. He imprisons <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> in a circular chain of great towers, both lofty and solid. For the period of more than a century, the houses press upon each other, accumulate, and raise their level in this basin, like water in a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reservoir" property="schema:name">reservoir</span>. They begin to deepen; they pile story upon story; they mount upon each other; they gush forth at the top, like all laterally compressed growth, and there is a rivalry as to which shall thrust its head above its neighbors, for the sake of getting a little air. The street glows narrower and deeper, every space is overwhelmed and disappears. The houses finally leap the wall of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Philip Augustus</span>, and scatter joyfully over the plain, without order, and all askew, like runaways. There they plant themselves squarely, cut themselves gardens from the fields, and take their ease. Beginning with 1367, the city spreads to such an extent into the suburbs, that a new wall becomes necessary, particularly on the right <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bank_(geography)" property="schema:name">bank</span>; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles V</span>. builds it. But a city like <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> is perpetually growing. It is only such cities that become capitals. They are funnels, into which all the geographical, political, moral, and intellectual water-sheds of a country, all the natural slopes of a people, pour; wells of civilization, so to speak, and also sewers, where commerce, industry, intelligence, population,—all that is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plant_sap" property="schema:name">sap</span>, all that is life, all that is the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> of a nation, filters and amasses unceasingly, drop by drop, century by century.</p>
<p>So <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_V_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles V</span>.'s wall suffered the fate of that of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Philip Augustus</span>. At the end of the fifteenth century, the Faubourg strides across it, passes beyond it, and runs farther. In the sixteenth, it seems to retreat visibly, and to bury itself deeper and deeper in the old city, so thick had the new city already become outside of it. Thus, beginning with the fifteenth century, where our story finds us, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> had already outgrown the three concentric circles of walls which, from the time of Julian the Apostate, existed, so to speak, in germ in the Grand-Châtelet and the Petit-Châtelet. The mighty city had cracked, in succession, its four enclosures of walls, like a child grown too large for his garments of last year. Under <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>., this sea of houses was seen to be pierced at intervals by several groups of ruined towers, from the ancient wall, like the summits of hills in an inundation,—like <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archipelago" property="schema:name">archipelagos</span> of the old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> submerged beneath the new. Since that time <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> has undergone yet another transformation, unfortunately for our eyes; but it has passed only one more wall, that of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XV_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XV</span>., that miserable wall of mud and spittle, worthy of the king who built it, worthy of the poet who sung it,—</p></body></html>
