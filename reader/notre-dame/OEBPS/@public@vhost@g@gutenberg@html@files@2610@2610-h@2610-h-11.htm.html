<p>"Was it the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> who wrote that?" she inquired in a changed voice.</p>
<p>"Yes, godmother," replied Bérangêre.</p>
<p>It was impossible to doubt it; the child did not know how to write.</p>
<p>"This is the secret!" thought <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the child's exclamation, all had hastened up, the mother, the young girls, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, and the officer.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> beheld the piece of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folly" property="schema:name">folly</span> which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> had committed. She turned <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span>, then pale, and began to tremble like a culprit before the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>, who gazed at her with a smile of satisfaction and amazement.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>!" whispered the young girls, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stupefied" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">stupefied</span>: "'tis the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span>'s name!"</p>
<p>"You have a marvellous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span>!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span>, to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petrifaction" property="schema:name">petrified</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>. Then, bursting into sobs: "Oh!" she stammered mournfully, hiding her face in both her beautiful hands, "she is a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magician_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magician</span>!" And she heard another and a still more bitter voice at the bottom of her heart, saying,—"She is a rival!"</p>
<p>She fell fainting.</p>
<p>"My daughter! my daughter!" cried the terrified mother. "Begone, you <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> of hell!"</p>
<p>In a twinkling, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">La Esmeralda</span> gathered up the unlucky letters, made a sign to Djali, and went out through one door, while <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">Fleur-de-Lys</span> was being carried out through the other.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_Phoebus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Captain Phoebus</span>, on being left alone, hesitated for a moment between the two doors, then he followed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00043">CHAPTER II. A PRIEST AND A PHILOSOPHER ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.</h2>
<p>The priest whom the young girls had observed at the top of the North tower, leaning over the Place and so attentive to the dance of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, was, in fact, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">Archdeacon</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>.</p>
<p>Our readers have not forgotten the mysterious cell which the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> had reserved for himself in that tower. (I do not know, by the way be it said, whether it be not the same, the interior of which can be seen to-day through a little square window, opening to the east at the height of a man above the platform from which the towers spring; a bare and dilapidated den, whose badly plastered walls are ornamented here and there, at the present day, with some wretched yellow engravings representing the façades of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cathedral" property="schema:name">cathedrals</span>. I presume that this hole is jointly inhabited by bats and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider" property="schema:name">spiders</span>, and that, consequently, it wages a double war of extermination on the flies).</p>
<p>Every day, an hour before <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sunset" property="schema:name">sunset</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> ascended the staircase to the tower, and shut himself up in this cell, where he sometimes passed whole nights. That day, at the moment when, standing before the low door of his retreat, he was fitting into the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lock_(water_transport)" property="schema:name">lock</span> the complicated little key which he always carried about him in the purse suspended to his side, a sound of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castanets" property="schema:name">castanets</span> had reached his ear. These sounds came from the Place du Parvis. The cell, as we have already said, had only one window opening upon the rear of the church. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> had hastily withdrawn the key, and an instant later, he was on the top of the tower, in the gloomy and pensive attitude in which the maidens had seen him.</p>
<p>There he st<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ood" property="schema:name">ood</span>, grave, motionless, absorbed in one look and one thought. All <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> lay at his feet, with the thousand spires of its edifices and its circular <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horizontal_coordinate_system" property="schema:name">horizon</span> of gentle hills—with its river winding under its bridges, and its people moving to and fro through its streets,—with the clouds of its smoke,—with the mountainous chain of its roofs which presses Notre-Dame in its doubled folds; but out of all the city, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> gazed at one corner only of the pavement, the Place du Parvis; in all that throng at but one figure,—the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>.</p>
<p>It would have been difficult to say what was the nature of this look, and whence proceeded the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire" property="schema:name">flame</span> that flashed from it. It was a fixed gaze, which was, nevertheless, full of trouble and tumult. And, from the profound immobility of his whole body, barely agitated at intervals by an involuntary shiver, as a tree is moved by the wind; from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stiffness" property="schema:name">stiffness</span> of his elbows, more <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> than the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span> on which they leaned; or the sight of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petrifaction" property="schema:name">petrified</span> smile which contracted his face,—one would have said that nothing living was left about <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> except his eyes.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> was dancing; she was twirling her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span> on the tip of her finger, and tossing it into the air as she danced <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provence" property="schema:name">Provençal</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sarabande" property="schema:name">sarabands</span>; agile, light, joyous, and unconscious of the formidable gaze which descended perpendicularly upon her head.</p>
<p>The crowd was swarming around her; from time to time, a man accoutred in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> and yellow made them form into a circle, and then returned, seated himself on a chair a few paces from the dancer, and took the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>'s head on his knees. This man seemed to be the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s companion. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> could not distinguish his features from his elevated post.</p>
<p>From the moment when the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> caught sight of this stranger, his attention seemed divided between him and the dancer, and his face became more and more gloomy. All at once he rose upright, and a quiver ran through his whole body: "Who is that man?" he muttered between his teeth: "I have always seen her alone before!"</p>
<p>Then he plunged down beneath the tortuous vault of the spiral staircase, and once more descended. As he passed the door of the bell chamber, which was ajar, he saw something which struck him; he beheld <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, who, leaning through an opening of one of those <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slate" property="schema:name">slate</span> penthouses which resemble enormous blinds, appeared also to be gazing at the Place. He was engaged in so profound a contemplation, that he did not notice the passage of his adopted father. His savage eye had a singular expression; it was a charmed, tender look. "This is strange!" <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathy_voice" property="schema:name">murmured</span> Claude. "Is it the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> at whom he is thus gazing?" He continued his descent. At the end of a few minutes, the anxious <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> entered upon the Place from the door at the base of the tower.</p>
<p>"What has become of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> girl?" he said, mingling with the group of spectators which the sound of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span> had collected.</p>
<p>"I know not," replied one of his neighbors, "I think that she has gone to make some of her fandangoes in the house opposite, whither they have called her."</p>
<p>In the place of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, on the carpet, whose <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabesque_(Islamic_art)" property="schema:name">arabesques</span> had seemed to vanish but a moment previously by the capricious figures of her dance, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> no longer beheld any one but the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> and yellow man, who, in order to earn a few testers in his turn, was walking round the circle, with his elbows on his hips, his head thrown back, his face <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span>, his neck outstretched, with a chair between his teeth. To the chair he had fastened a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" property="schema:name">cat</span>, which a neighbor had lent, and which was spitting in great affright.</p>
<p>"Notre-Dame!" exclaimed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, at the moment when the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Juggling" property="schema:name">juggler</span>, perspiring heavily, passed in front of him with his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyramid" property="schema:name">pyramid</span> of chair and his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" property="schema:name">cat</span>, "What is Master <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span> doing here?"</p>
<p>The harsh voice of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> threw the poor fellow into such a commotion that he lost his equilibrium, together with his whole edifice, and the chair and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" property="schema:name">cat</span> tumbled pell-mell upon the heads of the spectators, in the midst of inextinguishable hootings.</p>
<p>It is probable that Master <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span> (for it was indeed he) would have had a sorry account to settle with the neighbor who owned the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" property="schema:name">cat</span>, and all the bruised and scratched faces which surrounded him, if he had not hastened to profit by the tumult to take refuge in the church, whither <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span> had made him a sign to follow him.</p>
<p>The cathedral was already dark and deserted; the side-aisles were full of shadows, and the lamps of the chapels began to shine out like stars, so black had the vaulted ceiling become. Only the great <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rose_window" property="schema:name">rose window</span> of the façade, whose thousand colors were steeped in a ray of horizontal sunlight, glittered in the gloom like a mass of diamonds, and threw its dazzling reflection to the other end of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nave" property="schema:name">nave</span>.</p>
<p>When they had advanced a few paces, Dom Claude placed his back against a pillar, and gazed intently at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>. The gaze was not the one which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> feared, ashamed as he was of having been caught by a grave and learned person in the costume of a buffoon. There was nothing mocking or ironical in the priest's glance, it was serious, tranquil, piercing. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> was the first to break the silence.</p>
<p>"Come now, Master Pierre. You are to explain many things to me. And first of all, how comes it that you have not been seen for two months, and that now one finds you in the public squares, in a fine equipment in truth! Motley <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> and yellow, like a Caudebec apple?"</p>
<p>"Messire," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, piteously, "it is, in fact, an amazing accoutrement. You see me no more comfortable in it than a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" property="schema:name">cat</span> coiffed with a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Smoking_pipe_(tobacco)" property="schema:name">calabash</span>. 'Tis very ill done, I am conscious, to expose messieurs the sergeants of the watch to the liability of cudgelling beneath this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cassock" property="schema:name">cassock</span> the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Humerus" property="schema:name">humerus</span> of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pythagoras" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Pythagorean</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span>. But what would you have, my reverend master? 'tis the fault of my ancient jerkin, which abandoned me in cowardly wise, at the beginning of the winter, under the pretext that it was falling into tatters, and that it required repose in the basket of a rag-picker. What is one to do? Civilization has not yet arrived at the point where one can go stark naked, as ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diogenes_Laërtius" property="schema:name">Diogenes</span> wished. Add that a very cold wind was blowing, and 'tis not in the month of January that one can successfully attempt to make humanity take this new step. This garment presented itself, I took it, and I left my ancient black smock, which, for a hermetic like myself, was far from being <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermit" property="schema:name">hermetic</span>ally closed. Behold me then, in the garments of a stage-player, like Saint Genest. What would you have? 'tis an eclipse. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Apollo</span> himself tended the flocks of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Admetus" property="schema:name">Admetus</span>."</p>
<p>"'Tis a fine profession that you are engaged in!" replied the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>.</p>
<p>"I agree, my master, that 'tis better to philosophize and poetize, to blow the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire" property="schema:name">flame</span> in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span>, or to receive it from carry cats on a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shield" property="schema:name">shield</span>. So, when you addressed me, I was as foolish as an ass before a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rotisserie" property="schema:name">turnspit</span>. But what would you have, messire? One must eat every day, and the finest Alexandrine verses are not worth a bit of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brie" property="schema:name">Brie cheese</span>. Now, I made for Madame Marguerite of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flanders</span>, that famous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epithalamium" property="schema:name">epithalamium</span>, as you know, and the city will not pay me, under the pretext that it was not excellent; as though one could give a tragedy of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sophocles" property="schema:name">Sophocles</span> for four crowns! Hence, I was on the point of dying with hunger. Happily, I found that I was rather strong in the jaw; so I said to this jaw,—perform some feats of strength and of equilibrium: nourish thyself. <i>Ale te ipsam</i>. A pack of beggars who have become my good friends, have taught me twenty sorts of herculean feats, and now I give to my teeth every evening the bread which they have earned during the day by the sweat of my brow. After all, concede, I grant that it is a sad employment for my intellectual faculties, and that man is not made to pass his life in beating the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span> and biting chairs. But, reverend master, it is not sufficient to pass one's life, one must earn the means for life."</p>
<p>Dom Claude listened in silence. All at once his deep-set eye assumed so sagacious and penetrating an expression, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> felt himself, so to speak, searched to the bottom of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> by that glance.</p>
<p>"Very good, Master Pierre; but how comes it that you are now in company with that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> dancer?"</p>
<p>"In faith!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "'tis because she is my wife and I am her husband."</p>
<p>The priest's gloomy eyes flashed into <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire" property="schema:name">flame</span>.</p>
<p>"Have you done that, you wretch!" he cried, seizing <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>'s arm with fury; "have you been so abandoned by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> as to raise your hand against that girl?"</p>
<p>"On my chance of paradise, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monsignor" property="schema:name">monseigneur</span>," replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, trembling in every limb, "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Swear" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">I swear</span> to you that I have never touched her, if that is what disturbs you."</p>
<p>"Then why do you talk of husband and wife?" said the priest. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> made haste to relate to him as succinctly as possible, all that the reader already knows, his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adventure_game" property="schema:name">adventure</span> in the Court of Miracles and the broken-crock marriage. It appeared, moreover, that this marriage had led to no results whatever, and that each evening the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> girl cheated him of his nuptial right as on the first day. "'Tis a mortification," he said in conclusion, "but that is because I have had the misfortune to wed a virgin."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" demanded the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, who had been gradually appeased by this recital.</p>
<p>"'Tis very difficult to explain," replied the poet. "It is a superstition. My wife is, according to what an old thief, who is called among us the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egypt</span>, has told me, a foundling or a lost child, which is the same thing. She wears on her neck an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amulet" property="schema:name">amulet</span> which, it is affirmed, will cause her to meet her parents some day, but which will lose its virtue if the young girl loses hers. Hence it follows that both of us remain very virtuous."</p>
<p>"So," resumed Claude, whose brow cleared more and more, "you believe, Master Pierre, that this creature has not been approached by any man?"</p>
<p>"What would you have a man do, Dom Claude, as against a superstition? She has got that in her head. I assuredly esteem as a rarity this nunlike prudery which is preserved untamed amid those <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span> girls who are so easily brought into subjection. But she has three things to protect her: the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egypt</span>, who has taken her under his safeguard, reckoning, perchance, on selling her to some <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homosexuality" property="schema:name">gay</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abbot" property="schema:name">abbé</span>; all his tribe, who hold her in singular veneration, like a Notre-Dame; and a certain tiny <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poignard" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">poignard</span>, which the buxom dame always wears about her, in some nook, in spite of the ordinances of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(religion)" property="schema:name">provost</span>, and which one causes to fly out into her hands by squeezing her waist. 'Tis a proud <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wasp" property="schema:name">wasp</span>, I can tell you!"</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> pressed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> with questions.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">La Esmeralda</span>, in the judgment of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, was an inoffensive and charming creature, pretty, with the exception of a pout which was peculiar to her; a naïve and passionate damsel, ignorant of everything and enthusiastic about everything; not yet aware of the difference between a man and a woman, even in her dreams; made like that; wild especially over dancing, noise, the open air; a sort of woman bee, with invisible wings on her feet, and living in a whirlwind. She owed this nature to the wandering life which she had always led. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> had succeeded in learning that, while a mere child, she had traversed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spain" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Spain</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catalonia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Catalonia</span>, even to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily" typeof="schema:AdministrativeArea" property="schema:name">Sicily</span>; he believed that she had even been taken by the caravan of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Names_of_the_Romani_people" property="schema:name">Zingari</span>, of which she formed a part, to the kingdom of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Algiers" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Algiers</span>, a country situated in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaea" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Achaia</span>, which country adjoins, on one side <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Albania" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Albania</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greece" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Greece</span>; on the other, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sicily" typeof="schema:AdministrativeArea" property="schema:name">Sicilian</span> Sea, which is the road to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople" property="schema:name">Constantinople</span>. The Bohemians, said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, were vassals of the King of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Algiers" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Algiers</span>, in his quality of chief of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/White_people" property="schema:name">White</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moors" property="schema:name">Moors</span>. One thing is certain, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">la Esmeralda</span> had come to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span> while still very young, by way of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hungary" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Hungary</span>. From all these countries the young girl had brought back fragments of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queer" property="schema:name">queer</span> jargons, songs, and strange ideas, which made her language as motley as her costume, half Parisian, half African. However, the people of the quarters which she frequented loved her for her gayety, her daintiness, her lively manners, her dances, and her songs. She believed herself to be hated, in all the city, by but two persons, of whom she often spoke in terror: the sacked <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nun" property="schema:name">nun</span> of the Tour-Roland, a villanous recluse who cherished some secret grudge against these gypsies, and who cursed the poor dancer every time that the latter passed before her window; and a priest, who never met her without casting at her looks and words which frightened her.</p>
<p>The mention of this last circumstance disturbed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> greatly, though <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> paid no attention to his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perturbation_(astronomy)" property="schema:name">perturbation</span>; to such an extent had two months sufficed to cause the heedless poet to forget the singular details of the evening on which he had met the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, and the presence of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> in it all. Otherwise, the little dancer feared nothing; she did not tell fortunes, which protected her against those trials for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span> which were so frequently instituted against <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> women. And then, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> held the position of her brother, if not of her husband. After all, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span> endured this sort of platonic marriage very patiently. It meant a shelter and bread at least. Every morning, he set out from the lair of the thieves, generally with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>; he helped her make her collections of targes* and little blanks** in the squares; each evening he returned to the same roof with her, allowed her to bolt herself into her little chamber, and slept the sleep of the just. A very sweet existence, taking it all in all, he said, and well adapted to revery. And then, on his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> and conscience, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span> was not very sure that he was madly in love with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>. He loved her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> almost as dearly. It was a charming animal, gentle, intelligent, clever; a learned <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>. Nothing was more common in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span> than these learned animals, which amazed people greatly, and often led their instructors to the stake. But the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witchcraft</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> with the golden hoofs was a very innocent <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Species" property="schema:name">species</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span>. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> explained them to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, whom these details seemed to interest deeply. In the majority of cases, it was sufficient to present the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span> to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> in such or such a manner, in order to obtain from him the trick desired. He had been trained to this by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, who possessed, in these delicate arts, so rare a talent that two months had sufficed to teach the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> to write, with movable letters, the word "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>."</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  An ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Burgundy" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Burgundian</span> coin.<br/><br/>     ** An ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">French</span> coin.<br/></div>
<p>"'<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>!'" said the priest; "why '<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>'?"</p>
<p>"I know not," replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>. "Perhaps it is a word which she believes to be endowed with some <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span> and secret virtue. She often repeats it in a low tone when she thinks that she is alone."</p>
<p>"Are you sure," persisted Claude, with his penetrating glance, "that it is only a word and not a name?"</p>
<p>"The name of whom?" said the poet.</p>
<p>"How should I know?" said the priest.</p>
<p>"This is what I imagine, messire. These <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemian" property="schema:name">Bohemians</span> are something like Guebrs, and adore the sun. Hence, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>."</p>
<p>"That does not seem so clear to me as to you, Master Pierre."</p>
<p>"After all, that does not concern me. Let her mumble her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> at her pleasure. One thing is certain, that Djali loves me almost as much as he does her."</p>
<p>"Who is Djali?"</p>
<p>"The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>."</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> dropped his chin into his hand, and appeared to reflect for a moment. All at once he turned abruptly to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> once more.</p>
<p>"And do you swear to me that you have not touched her?"</p>
<p>"Whom?" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>; "the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>?"</p>
<p>"No, that woman."</p>
<p>"My wife? <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Swear" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">I swear</span> to you that I have not."</p>
<p>"You are often alone with her?"</p>
<p>"A good hour every evening."</p>
<p>Porn Claude frowned.</p>
<p>"Oh! oh! <i>Solus cum <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sola" typeof="schema:AdministrativeArea" property="schema:name">sola</span> non cogitabuntur orare <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord's_Prayer" property="schema:name">Pater Noster</span></i>."</p>
<p>"Upon my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, I could say the <i>Pater</i>, and the <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hail_Mary" property="schema:name">Ave Maria</span></i>, and the <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Credo" property="schema:name">Credo</span> in Deum patrem omnipotentem</i> without her paying any more attention to me than a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicken" property="schema:name">chicken</span> to a church."</p>
<p>"Swear to me, by the body of your mother," repeated the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> violently, "that you have not touched that creature with even the tip of your finger."</p>
<p>"I will also swear it by the head of my father, for the two things have more affinity between them. But, my reverend master, permit me a question in my turn."</p>
<p>"Speak, sir."</p>
<p>"What concern is it of yours?"</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>'s pale face became as crimson as the cheek of a young girl. He remained for a moment without answering; then, with visible embarrassment,—</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Listen_(Beyoncé_Knowles_song)" property="schema:name">Listen</span>, Master <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span>. You are not yet damned, so far as I know. I take an interest in you, and wish you well. Now the least contact with that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egyptian</span> of the demon would make you the vassal of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Satan" property="schema:name">Satan</span>. You know that 'tis always the body which ruins the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>. Woe to you if you approach that woman! That is all."</p>
<p>"I tried once," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scratching" property="schema:name">scratching</span> his ear; "it was the first day: but I got stung."</p>
<p>"You were so audacious, Master Pierre?" and the priest's brow clouded over again.</p>
<p>"On another occasion," continued the poet, with a smile, "I peeped through the keyhole, before going to bed, and I beheld the most delicious dame in her shift that ever made a bed creak under her bare foot."</p>
<p>"Go to the devil!" cried the priest, with a terrible look; and, giving the amazed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> a push on the shoulders, he plunged, with long strides, under the gloomiest <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arcade_(architecture)" property="schema:name">arcades</span> of the cathedral.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00044">CHAPTER III. THE BELLS.</h2>
<p>After the morning in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>, the neighbors of Notre-Dame thought they noticed that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>'s ardor for ringing had grown cool. Formerly, there had been peals for every occasion, long morning <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serenade" property="schema:name">serenades</span>, which lasted from prime to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Compline" property="schema:name">compline</span>; peals from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">belfry</span> for a high mass, rich scales drawn over the smaller bells for a wedding, for a christening, and mingling in the air like a rich <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Embroidery" property="schema:name">embroidery</span> of all sorts of charming sounds. The old church, all vibrating and sonorous, was in a perpetual joy of bells. One was constantly conscious of the presence of a spirit of noise and caprice, who sang through all those mouths of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brass" property="schema:name">brass</span>. Now that spirit seemed to have departed; the cathedral seemed gloomy, and gladly remained <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span>; festivals and funerals had the simple <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ring_of_bells" property="schema:name">peal</span>, dry and bare, demanded by the ritual, nothing more. Of the double noise which constitutes a church, the organ within, the bell without, the organ alone remained. One would have said that there was no longer a musician in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">belfry</span>. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was always there, nevertheless; what, then, had happened to him? Was it that the shame and despair of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span> still lingered in the bottom of his heart, that the lashes of his tormentor's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Whip" property="schema:name">whip</span> reverberated unendingly in his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>, and that the sadness of such treatment had wholly extinguished in him even his passion for the bells? or was it that Marie had a rival in the heart of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> of Notre-Dame, and that the great bell and her fourteen sisters were neglected for something more amiable and more beautiful?</p>
<p>It chanced that, in the year of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_grace" property="schema:name">grace</span> 1482, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Annunciation" property="schema:name">Annunciation</span> Day fell on Tuesday, the twenty-fifth of March. That day the air was so pure and light that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> felt some returning affection for his bells. He therefore ascended the northern tower while the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beadle" property="schema:name">beadle</span> below was opening wide the doors of the church, which were then enormous panels of stout wood, covered with leather, bordered with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nail_(fastener)" property="schema:name">nails</span> of gilded <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wrought_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span>, and framed in carvings "very artistically elaborated."</p>
<p>On arriving in the lofty bell chamber, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> gazed for some time at the six bells and shook his head sadly, as though groaning over some foreign element which had interposed itself in his heart between them and him. But when he had set them to swinging, when he felt that cluster of bells moving under his hand, when he saw, for he did not hear it, the palpitating <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Octave" property="schema:name">octave</span> ascend and descend that sonorous scale, like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">bird</span> hopping from branch to branch; when the demon Music, that demon who shakes a sparkling bundle of strette, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trill_(music)" property="schema:name">trills</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arpeggio" property="schema:name">arpeggios</span>, had taken possession of the poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man, he became happy once more, he forgot everything, and his heart expanding, made his face beam.</p>
<p>He went and came, he beat his hands together, he ran from rope to rope, he animated the six singers with voice and gesture, like the leader of an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra" property="schema:name">orchestra</span> who is urging on intelligent musicians.</p>
<p>"Go on," said he, "go on, go on, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gabrielle_Solis" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Gabrielle</span>, pour out all thy noise into the Place, 'tis a festival to-day. No laziness, Thibauld; thou art relaxing; go on, go on, then, art thou rusted, thou sluggard? That is well! quick! quick! let not thy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_(instrument)" property="schema:name">clapper</span> be seen! Make them all <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> like me. That's it, Thibauld, bravely done! Guillaume! Guillaume! thou art the largest, and Pasquier is the smallest, and Pasquier does best. Let us wager that those who hear him will understand him better than they understand thee. Good! good! my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gabrielle_Solis" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Gabrielle</span>, stoutly, more stoutly! Eli! what are you doing up aloft there, you two Moineaux (<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparrow" property="schema:name">sparrows</span>)? I do not see you making the least little shred of noise. What is the meaning of those beaks of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copper" property="schema:name">copper</span> which seem to be gaping when they should sing? Come, work now, 'tis the Feast of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Annunciation" property="schema:name">Annunciation</span>. The sun is fine, the chime must be fine also. Poor Guillaume! thou art all out of breath, my big fellow!"</p>
<p>He was wholly absorbed in spurring on his bells, all six of which vied with each other in leaping and shaking their shining haunches, like a noisy team of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spanish_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Spanish</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mule" property="schema:name">mules</span>, pricked on here and there by the apostrophes of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arriero" property="schema:name">muleteer</span>.</p>
<p>All at once, on letting his glance fall between the large <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slate" property="schema:name">slate</span> scales which cover the perpendicular wall of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell tower</span> at a certain height, he beheld on the square a young girl, fantastically dressed, stop, spread out on the ground a carpet, on which a small <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> took up its post, and a group of spectators collect around her. This sight suddenly changed the course of his ideas, and congealed his enthusiasm as a breath of air congeals melted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rosin" property="schema:name">rosin</span>. He halted, turned his back to the bells, and crouched down behind the projecting roof of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slate" property="schema:name">slate</span>, fixing upon the dancer that dreamy, sweet, and tender look which had already astonished the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> on one occasion. Meanwhile, the forgotten bells died away abruptly and all together, to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Disappointment" property="schema:name">great disappointment</span> of the lovers of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bell ringing</span>, who were listening in good faith to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">peal</span> from above the Pont du Change, and who went away dumbfounded, like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">dog</span> who has been offered a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bone" property="schema:name">bone</span> and given a stone.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00045">CHAPTER IV. <i>ANArKH</i>.</h2>
<p>It chanced that upon a fine morning in this same month of March, I think it was on Saturday the 29th, Saint Eustache's day, our young friend the student, Jehan Frollo du Moulin, perceived, as he was dressing himself, that his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breeches" property="schema:name">breeches</span>, which contained his purse, gave out no metallic ring. "Poor purse," he said, drawing it from his fob, "what! not the smallest parisis! how cruelly the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dice" property="schema:name">dice</span>, beer-pots, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venus_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Venus</span> have depleted thee! How empty, wrinkled, limp, thou art! Thou resemblest the throat of a fury! I ask you, Messer <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Cicero</span>, and Messer <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seneca_the_Younger" property="schema:name">Seneca</span>, copies of whom, all <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">dog</span>'s-eared, I behold scattered on the floor, what profits it me to know, better than any governor of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mint_(coin)" property="schema:name">mint</span>, or any Jew on the Pont aux Changeurs, that a golden <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span> stamped with a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span> is worth thirty-five unzains of twenty-five sous, and eight deniers parisis apiece, and that a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span> stamped with a crescent is worth thirty-six unzains of twenty-six sous, six deniers tournois apiece, if I have not a single wretched black <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_livre" property="schema:name">liard</span> to risk on the double-six! Oh! Consul <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Cicero</span>! this is no calamity from which one extricates one's self with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Periphrasis" property="schema:name">periphrases</span>, <i>quemadmodum</i>, and <i>verum enim vero</i>!"</p>
<p>He dressed himself sadly. An idea had occurred to him as he laced his boots, but he rejected it at first; nevertheless, it returned, and he put on his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Waistcoat" property="schema:name">waistcoat</span> wrong side out, an evident sign of violent internal combat. At last he dashed his cap roughly on the floor, and exclaimed: "So much the worse! Let come of it what may. I am going to my brother! I shall catch a sermon, but I shall catch a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span>."</p>
<p>Then he hastily donned his long jacket with furred half-sleeves, picked up his cap, and went out like a man driven to desperation.</p>
<p>He descended the Rue de la Harpe toward the City. As he passed the Rue de la Huchette, the odor of those admirable spits, which were incessantly turning, tickled his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olfaction" property="schema:name">olfactory</span> apparatus, and he bestowed a loving glance toward the Cyclopean roast, which one day drew from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franciscan" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">Franciscan</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friar" property="schema:name">friar</span>, Calatagirone, this pathetic exclamation: <i>Veramente, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Septimus_Heap" property="schema:name">queste</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rotisserie" property="schema:name">rotisserie</span> sono cosa stupenda</i>!* But Jehan had not the wherewithal to buy a breakfast, and he plunged, with a profound sigh, under the gateway of the Petit-Châtelet, that enormous double <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trefoil" property="schema:name">trefoil</span> of massive towers which guarded the entrance to the City.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  Truly, these roastings are a stupendous thing!<br/></div>
<p>He did not even take the trouble to cast a stone in passing, as was the usage, at the miserable statue of that Périnet <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Leclerc" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Leclerc</span> who had delivered up the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_VI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles VI</span>. to the English, a crime which his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Effigy" property="schema:name">effigy</span>, its face battered with stones and soiled with mud, expiated for three centuries at the corner of the Rue de la Harpe and the Rue de Buci, as in an eternal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>.</p>
<p>The Petit-Pont traversed, the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève crossed, Jehan de Molendino found himself in front of Notre-Dame. Then indecision seized upon him once more, and he paced for several minutes round the statue of M. Legris, repeating to himself with anguish: "The sermon is sure, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span> is doubtful."</p>
<p>He stopped a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beadle" property="schema:name">beadle</span> who emerged from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span>,—"Where is monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> of Josas?"</p>
<p>"I believe that he is in his secret cell in the tower," said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beadle" property="schema:name">beadle</span>; "I should advise you not to disturb him there, unless you come from some one like the pope or monsieur the king."</p>
<p>Jehan clapped his hands.</p>
<p>"<i>Bécliable</i>! here's a magnificent chance to see the famous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">sorcery</span> cell!"</p>
<p>This reflection having brought him to a decision, he plunged resolutely into the small black doorway, and began the ascent of the spiral of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Giles" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint-Gilles</span>, which leads to the upper stories of the tower. "I am going to see," he said to himself on the way. "By the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raven" property="schema:name">ravens</span> of the Holy Virgin! it must needs be a curious thing, that cell which my reverend brother hides so secretly! 'Tis said that he lights up the kitchens of hell there, and that he cooks the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span>'s stone there over a hot fire. <i>Bédieu</i>! I care no more for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span>'s stone than for a pebble, and I would rather find over his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span> an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Omelette" property="schema:name">omelette</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Easter_egg_(media)" property="schema:name">Easter eggs</span> and bacon, than the biggest <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span>'s stone in the world."'</p>
<p>On arriving at the gallery of slender columns, he took breath for a moment, and swore against the interminable staircase by I know not how many million cartloads of devils; then he resumed his ascent through the narrow door of the north tower, now closed to the public. Several moments after passing the bell chamber, he came upon a little landing-place, built in a lateral niche, and under the vault of a low, pointed door, whose enormous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lock_(water_transport)" property="schema:name">lock</span> and strong <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> bars he was enabled to see through a loophole pierced in the opposite circular wall of the staircase. Persons desirous of visiting this door at the present day will recognize it by this inscription engraved in white letters on the black wall: "J'ADORE <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/CORALIE_spectrograph" property="schema:name">CORALIE</span>, 1823. SIGNE UGENE." "Signé" stands in the text.</p>
<p>"Ugh!" said the scholar; "'tis here, no doubt."</p>
<p>The key was in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lock_(water_transport)" property="schema:name">lock</span>, the door was very close to him; he gave it a gentle push and thrust his head through the opening.</p>
<p>The reader cannot have failed to turn over the admirable works of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rembrandt" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Rembrandt</span>, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Shakespeare" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Shakespeare</span> of painting. Amid so many marvellous engravings, there is one <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Etching" property="schema:name">etching</span> in particular, which is supposed to represent <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Faust" property="schema:name">Doctor Faust</span>, and which it is impossible to contemplate without being dazzled. It represents a gloomy cell; in the centre is a table loaded with hideous objects; skulls, spheres, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alembic" property="schema:name">alembics</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Compass" property="schema:name">compasses</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egyptian_hieroglyphs" property="schema:name">hieroglyphic</span> parchments. The doctor is before this table clad in his large coat and covered to the very eyebrows with his furred cap. He is visible only to his waist. He has half risen from his immense arm-chair, his clenched fists rest on the table, and he is gazing with curiosity and terror at a large luminous circle, formed of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span> letters, which gleams from the wall beyond, like the solar spectrum in a dark chamber. This <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kabbalah" property="schema:name">cabalistic</span> sun s<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ems_(river)" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">eems</span> to tremble before the eye, and fills the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wide_area_network" property="schema:name">wan</span> cell with its mysterious <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radiance" property="schema:name">radiance</span>. It is horrible and it is beautiful.</p>
<p>Something very similar to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Faust" property="schema:name">Faust</span>'s cell presented itself to Jehan's view, when he ventured his head through the half-open door. It also was a gloomy and sparsely lighted retreat. There also stood a large arm-chair and a large table, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Compass" property="schema:name">compasses</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alembic" property="schema:name">alembics</span>, skeletons of animals suspended from the ceiling, a globe rolling on the floor, hippocephali mingled promiscuously with drinking cups, in which quivered leaves of gold, skulls placed upon <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vellum" property="schema:name">vellum</span> checkered with figures and characters, huge manuscripts piled up wide open, without mercy on the cracking corners of the parchment; in short, all the rubbish of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science" property="schema:name">science</span>, and everywhere on this confusion dust and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider" property="schema:name">spiders</span>' webs; but there was no circle of luminous letters, no doctor in an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religious_ecstasy" property="schema:name">ecstasy</span> contemplating the flaming vision, as the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eagle" property="schema:name">eagle</span> gazes upon the sun.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the cell was not deserted. A man was seated in the arm-chair, and bending over the table. Jehan, to whom his back was turned, could see only his shoulders and the back of his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_skull" property="schema:name">skull</span>; but he had no difficulty in recognizing that bald head, which nature had provided with an eternal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tonsure" property="schema:name">tonsure</span>, as though desirous of marking, by this external symbol, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>'s irresistible clerical vocation.</p>
<p>Jehan accordingly recognized his brother; but the door had been opened so softly, that nothing warned Dom Claude of his presence. The inquisitive scholar took advantage of this circumstance to examine the cell for a few moments at his leisure. A large <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span>, which he had not at first observed, stood to the left of the arm-chair, beneath the window. The ray of light which penetrated through this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aperture" property="schema:name">aperture</span> made its way through a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spider" property="schema:name">spider</span>'s circular web, which tastefully inscribed its delicate rose in the arch of the window, and in the centre of which the insect architect hung motionless, like the hub of this wheel of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lace" property="schema:name">lace</span>. Upon the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span> were accumulated in disorder, all sorts of vases, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earthenware" property="schema:name">earthenware</span> bottles, glass retorts, and mattresses of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charcoal" property="schema:name">charcoal</span>. Jehan observed, with a sigh, that there was no frying-pan. "How cold the kitchen utensils are!" he said to himself.</p>
<p>In fact, there was no fire in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span>, and it seemed as though none had been lighted for a long time. A glass mask, which Jehan noticed among the utensils of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alchemy" property="schema:name">alchemy</span>, and which served no doubt, to protect the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>'s face when he was working over some substance to be dreaded, lay in one corner covered with dust and apparently forgotten. Beside it lay a pair of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bellows" property="schema:name">bellows</span> no less dusty, the upper side of which bore this inscription incrusted in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copper" property="schema:name">copper</span> letters: <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spira_(Final_Fantasy)" property="schema:name">SPIRA</span> SPERA.</p>
<p>Other inscriptions were written, in accordance with the fashion of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermeticism" property="schema:name">hermetics</span>, in great numbers on the walls; some traced with ink, others engraved with a metal point. There were, moreover, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blackletter" property="schema:name">Gothic letters</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hebrew_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Hebrew</span> letters, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece" property="schema:name">Greek</span> letters, and Roman letters, pell-mell; the inscriptions overflowed at haphazard, on top of each other, the more recent effacing the more ancient, and all entangled with each other, like the branches in a thicket, like <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pike_(weapon)" property="schema:name">pikes</span> in an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Affray" property="schema:name">affray</span>. It was, in fact, a strangely confused mingling of all human philosophies, all reveries, all human wisdom. Here and there one shone out from among the rest like a banner among lance heads. Generally, it was a brief <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Greek</span> or Roman device, such as the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span> knew so well how to formulate.—<i>Unde? Inde?—<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homo_Homini_Award" property="schema:name">Homo homini</span> monstrurn-Ast'ra, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castra" property="schema:name">castra</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_naming_conventions" property="schema:name">nomen</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Numen" property="schema:name">numen</span>.—Meya Bibklov, ueya xaxov.—Sapere <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aude" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">aude</span>. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fiat" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">Fiat</span> ubi vult</i>—etc.; sometimes a word devoid of all apparent sense, <i>Avayxoqpayia</i>, which possibly contained a bitter allusion to the regime of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span>; sometimes a simple maxim of clerical discipline formulated in a regular <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hexameter" property="schema:name">hexameter</span> <i>Coelestem dominum terrestrem dicite dominum</i>. There was also <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hebrew_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Hebrew</span> jargon, of which Jehan, who as yet knew but little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Greek</span>, understood nothing; and all were traversed in every direction by stars, by figures of men or animals, and by intersecting triangles; and this contributed not a little to make the scrawled wall of the cell resemble a sheet of paper over which a monkey had drawn back and forth a pen filled with ink.</p>
<p>The whole chamber, moreover, presented a general aspect of abandonment and dilapidation; and the bad state of the utensils induced the supposition that their owner had long been distracted from his labors by other preoccupations. Meanwhile, this master, bent over a vast <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manuscript" property="schema:name">manuscript</span>, ornamented with fantastical illustrations, appeared to be tormented by an idea which incessantly mingled with his meditations. That at least was Jehan's idea, when he heard him exclaim, with the thoughtful breaks of a dreamer thinking aloud,—</p>
<p>"Yes, Manou said it, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroaster" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Zoroaster</span> taught it! the sun is born from fire, the moon from the sun; fire is the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> of the universe; its elementary atoms pour forth and flow incessantly upon the world through infinite channels! At the point where these currents intersect each other in the heavens, they produce light; at their points of intersection on earth, they produce gold. Light, gold; the same thing! From fire to the concrete state. The difference between the visible and the palpable, between the fluid and the solid in the same substance, between water and ice, nothing more. These are no dreams; it is the general law of nature. But what is one to do in order to extract from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Natural_philosophy" property="schema:name">science</span> the secret of this general law? What! this light which inundates my hand is gold! These same atoms dilated in accordance with a certain law need only be condensed in accordance with another law. How is it to be done? Some have fancied by burying a ray of sunlight, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Averroes" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Averroës</span>,—yes, 'tis <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Averroes" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Averroës</span>,—<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Averroes" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Averroës</span> buried one under the first pillar on the left of the sanctuary of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quran" property="schema:name">Koran</span>, in the great Mahometan <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mosque" property="schema:name">mosque</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Córdoba,_Andalusia" property="schema:name">Cordova</span>; but the vault cannot be opened for the purpose of ascertaining whether the operation has succeeded, until after the lapse of eight thousand years.</p>
<p>"The devil!" said Jehan, to himself, "'tis a long while to wait for a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span>!"</p>
<p>"Others have thought," continued the dreamy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, "that it would be better worth while to operate upon a ray of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sirius" property="schema:name">Sirius</span>. But 'tis exceeding hard to obtain this ray pure, because of the simultaneous presence of other stars whose rays mingle with it. Flamel esteemed it more simple to operate upon <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earth" property="schema:name">terrestrial</span> fire. Flamel! there's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Predestination" property="schema:name">predestination</span> in the name! <i>Flamma</i>! yes, fire. All lies there. The diamond is contained in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carbon" property="schema:name">carbon</span>, gold is in the fire. But how to extract it? Magistri affirms that there are certain feminine names, which possess a charm so sweet and mysterious, that it suffices to pronounce them during the operation. Let us read what <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manon" property="schema:name">Manon</span> says on the matter: 'Where women are honored, the divinities are rejoiced; where they are despised, it is useless to pray to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>. The mouth of a woman is constantly pure; it is a running water, it is a ray of sunlight. The name of a woman should be agreeable, sweet, fanciful; it should end in long vowels, and resemble words of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benediction" property="schema:name">benediction</span>.' Yes, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">sage</span> is right; in truth, Maria, Sophia, la Esmeral—Damnation! always that thought!"</p>
<p>And he closed the book violently.</p>
<p>He passed his hand over his brow, as though to brush away the idea which assailed him; then he took from the table a nail and a small <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hammer" property="schema:name">hammer</span>, whose handle was curiously painted with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kabbalah" property="schema:name">cabalistic</span> letters.</p>
<p>"For some time," he said with a bitter smile, "I have failed in all my experiments! one fixed idea possesses me, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sears" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">sears</span> my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brain" property="schema:name">brain</span> like fire. I have not even been able to discover the secret of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cassiodorus" property="schema:name">Cassiodorus</span>, whose lamp burned without <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capillary_action" property="schema:name">wick</span> and without oil. A simple matter, nevertheless—"</p>
<p>"The deuce!" muttered Jehan in his beard.</p>
<p>"Hence," continued the priest, "one wretched thought is sufficient to render a man weak and beside himself! Oh! how Claude Pernelle would laugh at me. She who could not turn <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolas_Flamel" property="schema:name">Nicholas Flamel</span> aside, for one moment, from his pursuit of the great work! What! I hold in my hand the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hammer" property="schema:name">hammer</span> of Zéchiélé! at every blow dealt by the formidable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rabbi" property="schema:name">rabbi</span>, from the depths of his cell, upon this nail, that one of his enemies whom he had condemned, were he a thousand leagues away, was buried a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cubit" property="schema:name">cubit</span> deep in the earth which swallowed him. The King of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span> himself, in consequence of once having inconsiderately knocked at the door of the thermaturgist, sank to the knees through the pavement of his own <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. This took place three centuries ago. Well! I possess the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hammer" property="schema:name">hammer</span> and the nail, and in my hands they are utensils no more formidable than a club in the hands of a maker of edge tools. And yet all that is required is to find the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span> word which Zéchiélé pronounced when he struck his nail."</p>
<p>"What nonsense!" thought Jehan.</p>
<p>"Let us see, let us try!" resumed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> briskly. "Were I to succeed, I should behold the blue spark flash from the head of the nail. Emen-Hétan! Emen-Hétan! That's not it. Sigéani! Sigéani! May this nail open the tomb to any one who bears the name of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span>! A curse upon it! Always and eternally the same idea!"</p>
<p>And he flung away the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hammer" property="schema:name">hammer</span> in a rage. Then he sank down so deeply on the arm-chair and the table, that Jehan lost him from view behind the great pile of manuscripts. For the space of several minutes, all that he saw was his fist convulsively clenched on a book. Suddenly, Dom Claude sprang up, seized a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Compass" property="schema:name">compass</span> and engraved in silence upon the wall in capital letters, this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Greek</span> word</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">         <i>ANArKH</i>.<br/></div>
<p>"My brother is mad," said Jehan to himself; "it would have been far more simple to write <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fatum_(Tchaikovsky)" property="schema:name">Fatum</span></i>, every one is not obliged to know <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Greek</span>."</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> returned and seated himself in his armchair, and placed his head on both his hands, as a sick man does, whose head is heavy and burning.</p>
<p>The student watched his brother with surprise. He did not know, he who wore his heart on his sleeve, he who observed only the good old law of Nature in the world, he who allowed his passions to follow their inclinations, and in whom the lake of great emotions was always dry, so freely did he let it off each day by fresh drains,—he did not know with what fury the sea of human passions ferments and boils when all egress is denied to it, how it accumulates, how it swells, how it overflows, how it hollows out the heart; how it breaks in inward sobs, and dull <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Convulsion" property="schema:name">convulsions</span>, until it has rent its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Levee" property="schema:name">dikes</span> and burst its bed. The austere and glacial envelope of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>, that cold surface of steep and inaccessible virtue, had always deceived Jehan. The merry scholar had never dreamed that there was boiling <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lava" property="schema:name">lava</span>, furious and profound, beneath the snowy brow of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mount_Etna" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">AEtna</span>.</p>
<p>We do not know whether he suddenly became conscious of these things; but, giddy as he was, he understood that he had seen what he ought not to have seen, that he had just surprised the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span> of his elder brother in one of its most secret altitudes, and that Claude must not be allowed to know it. Seeing that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> had fallen back into his former immobility, he withdrew his head very softly, and made some noise with his feet outside the door, like a person who has just arrived and is giving warning of his approach.</p>
<p>"Enter!" cried the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, from the interior of his cell; "I was expecting you. I left the door unlocked expressly; enter Master Jacques!"</p>
<p>The scholar entered boldly. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, who was very much embarrassed by such a visit in such a place, trembled in his arm-chair. "What! 'tis you, Jehan?"</p>
<p>"'Tis a J, all the same," said the scholar, with his ruddy, merry, and audacious face.</p>
<p>Dom Claude's visage had resumed its severe expression.</p>
<p>"What are you come for?"</p>
<p>"Brother," replied the scholar, making an effort to assume a decent, pitiful, and modest <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yao_people" property="schema:name">mien</span>, and twirling his cap in his hands with an innocent air; "I am come to ask of you—"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"A little lecture on morality, of which I stand greatly in need," Jehan did not dare to add aloud,—"and a little money of which I am in still greater need." This last member of his phrase remained unuttered.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, in a cold tone, "I am greatly displeased with you."</p>
<p>"Alas!" sighed the scholar.</p>
<p>Dom Claude made his arm-chair describe a quarter circle, and gazed intently at Jehan.</p>
<p>"I am very glad to see you."</p>
<p>This was a formidable exordium. Jehan braced himself for a rough encounter.</p>
<p>"Jehan, complaints are brought me about you every day. What <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Affray" property="schema:name">affray</span> was that in which you bruised with a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Club_(weapon)" property="schema:name">cudgel</span> a little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viscount" property="schema:name">vicomte</span>, Albert de Ramonchamp?"</p>
<p>"Oh!" said Jehan, "a vast thing that! A malicious page amused himself by splashing the scholars, by making his horse <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse_gait" property="schema:name">gallop</span> through the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bog" property="schema:name">mire</span>!"</p>
<p>"Who," pursued the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, "is that Mahiet Fargel, whose gown you have torn? <i>Tunicam dechiraverunt</i>, saith the complaint."</p>
<p>"Ah bah! a wretched cap of a Montaigu! Isn't that it?"</p>
<p>"The complaint says <i>tunicam</i> and not <i>cappettam</i>. Do you know <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span>?"</p>
<p>Jehan did not reply.</p>
<p>"Yes," pursued the priest shaking his head, "that is the state of learning and letters at the present day. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span> tongue is hardly understood, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syriac_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Syriac</span> is unknown, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Greek</span> so odious that 'tis accounted no ignorance in the most learned to skip a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Greek</span> word without reading it, and to say, '<i>Groecum est non legitur</i>.'"</p>
<p>The scholar raised his eyes boldly. "Monsieur my brother, doth it please you that I shall explain in good <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">French</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_French" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">vernacular</span> that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Greek</span> word which is written yonder on the wall?"</p>
<p>"What word?"</p>
<p>"'<i>ANArKH</i>."</p>
<p>A slight flush spread over the cheeks of the priest with their high bones, like the puff of smoke which announces on the outside the secret commotions of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volcano" property="schema:name">volcano</span>. The student hardly noticed it.</p>
<p>"Well, Jehan," stammered the elder brother with an effort, "What is the meaning of yonder word?"</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Destiny" property="schema:name">FATE</span>."</p>
<p>Dom Claude turned pale again, and the scholar pursued carelessly.</p>
<p>"And that word below it, graved by the same hand, '<i>Ayáyvela</i>, signifies 'impurity.' You see that people do know their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Greek</span>."</p>
<p>And the archdeacon remained <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span>. This <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Greek</span> lesson had rendered him thoughtful.</p>
<p>Master Jehan, who possessed all the artful ways of a spoiled child, judged that the moment was a favorable one in which to risk his request. Accordingly, he assumed an extremely soft tone and began,—</p>
<p>"My good brother, do you hate me to such a degree as to look savagely upon me because of a few mischievous cuffs and blows distributed in a fair war to a pack of lads and brats, <i>quibusdam marmosetis</i>? You see, good Brother Claude, that people know their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span>."</p>
<p>But all this caressing hypocrisy did not have its usual effect on the severe elder brother. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cerberus" property="schema:name">Cerberus</span> did not bite at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Honey" property="schema:name">honey</span> cake. The archdeacon's brow did not lose a single wrinkle.</p>
<p>"What are you driving at?" he said dryly.</p>
<p>"Well, in point of fact, this!" replied Jehan bravely, "I stand in need of money."</p>
<p>At this audacious declaration, the archdeacon's visage assumed a thoroughly pedagogical and paternal expression.</p>
<p>"You know, Monsieur Jehan, that our <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fee_(feudal_tenure)" property="schema:name">fief</span> of Tirechappe, putting the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Direct_tax" property="schema:name">direct taxes</span> and the rents of the nine and twenty houses in a block, yields only nine and thirty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span>, eleven sous, six deniers, Parisian. It is one half more than in the time of the brothers Paclet, but it is not much."</p>
<p>"I need money," said Jehan stoically.</p>
<p>"You know that the official has decided that our twenty-one houses should he moved full into the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fee_(feudal_tenure)" property="schema:name">fief</span> of the Bishopric, and that we could redeem this homage only by paying the reverend bishop two marks of silver gilt of the price of six livres parisis. Now, these two marks I have not yet been able to get together. You know it."</p>
<p>"I know that I stand in need of money," repeated Jehan for the third time.</p>
<p>"And what are you going to do with it?"</p>
<p>This question caused a flash of hope to gleam before Jehan's eyes. He resumed his dainty, caressing air.</p>
<p>"Stay, dear Brother Claude, I should not come to you, with any evil motive. There is no intention of cutting a dash in the taverns with your unzains, and of strutting about the streets of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> in a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caparison" property="schema:name">caparison</span> of gold <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brocade" property="schema:name">brocade</span>, with a lackey, <i>cum <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Meo_(Portugal)" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">meo</span> laquasio</i>. No, brother, 'tis for a good work."</p>
<p>"What good work?" demanded Claude, somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>"Two of my friends wish to purchase an outfit for the infant of a poor Haudriette widow. It is a charity. It will cost three forms, and I should like to contribute to it."</p>
<p>"What are names of your two friends?"</p>
<p>"Pierre l'Assommeur and Baptiste Croque-Oison*."</p></body></html>
