<body prefix="schema: http://schema.org/"><div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  The representation of a monstrous animal solemnly drawn about<br/>in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tarascon" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Tarascon</span> and other <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">French</span> towns.<br/></div>
<p>Without doubt, this strange beacon light would awaken far away, the woodcutter of the hills of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bicêtre_Hospital" property="schema:name">Bicêtre</span>, terrified to behold the gigantic shadow of the towers of Notre-Dame quivering over his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heath" property="schema:name">heaths</span>.</p>
<p>A terrified silence ensued among the outcasts, during which nothing was heard, but the cries of alarm of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canon_(priest)" property="schema:name">canons</span> shut up in their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span>, and more uneasy than horses in a burning stable, the furtive sound of windows hastily opened and still more hastily closed, the internal hurly-burly of the houses and of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hôtel-Dieu_de_Paris" property="schema:name">Hôtel-Dieu</span>, the wind in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire" property="schema:name">flame</span>, the last death-rattle of the dying, and the continued crackling of the rain of lead upon the pavement.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the principal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span> had retired beneath the porch of the Gondelaurier mansion, and were holding a council of war.</p>
<p>The Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egypt</span>, seated on a stone post, contemplated the phantasmagorical bonfire, glowing at a height of two hundred feet in the air, with religious terror. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span> bit his huge fists with rage.</p>
<p>"Impossible to get in!" he muttered between his teeth.</p>
<p>"An old, enchanted church!" grumbled the aged <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bohemia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bohemian</span>, Mathias Hungadi Spicali.</p>
<p>"By the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span>'s whiskers!" went on a sham soldier, who had once been in service, "here are church gutters spitting melted lead at you better than the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Machicolation" property="schema:name">machicolations</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lectoure" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Lectoure</span>."</p>
<p>"Do you see that demon passing and repassing in front of the fire?" exclaimed the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egypt</span>.</p>
<p>"Pardieu, 'tis that damned <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span>, 'tis <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>.</p>
<p>The Bohemian tossed his head. "I tell you, that 'tis the spirit Sabnac, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercury_Grand_Marquis" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">grand marquis</span>, the demon of fortifications. He has the form of an armed soldier, the head of a lion. Sometimes he rides a hideous horse. He changes men into stones, of which he builds towers. He commands fifty legions 'Tis he indeed; I recognize him. Sometimes he is clad in a handsome golden robe, figured after the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Turkish</span> fashion."</p>
<p>"Where is Bellevigne de l'Etoile?" demanded <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>.</p>
<p>"He is dead."</p>
<p>Andry the Red laughed in an idiotic way: "Notre-Dame is making work for the hospital," said he.</p>
<p>"Is there, then, no way of forcing this door," exclaimed the King of Thunes, stamping his foot.</p>
<p>The Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egypt</span> pointed sadly to the two streams of boiling lead which did not cease to streak the black facade, like two long <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Distaff" property="schema:name">distaffs</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phosphorus" property="schema:name">phosphorus</span>.</p>
<p>"Churches have been known to defend themselves thus all by themselves," he remarked with a sigh. "Saint-Sophia at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople" property="schema:name">Constantinople</span>, forty years ago, hurled to the earth three times in succession, the crescent of Mahom, by shaking her domes, which are her heads. Guillaume de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, who built this one was a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magician_(fantasy)" property="schema:name">magician</span>."</p>
<p>"Must we then retreat in pitiful fashion, like <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Highwayman" property="schema:name">highwaymen</span>?" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>. "Must we leave our sister here, whom those hooded <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Werewolf" property="schema:name">wolves</span> will hang to-morrow."</p>
<p>"And the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sacristy" property="schema:name">sacristy</span>, where there are wagon-loads of gold!" added a vagabond, whose name, we regret to say, we do not know.</p>
<p>"Beard of Mahom!" cried Trouillefou.</p>
<p>"Let us make another trial," resumed the vagabond.</p>
<p>Mathias Hungadi shook his head.</p>
<p>"We shall never get in by the door. We must find the defect in the armor of the old fairy; a hole, a false <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Postern" property="schema:name">postern</span>, some joint or other."</p>
<p>"Who will go with me?" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>. "I shall go at it again. By the way, where is the little scholar Jehan, who is so encased in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span>?"</p>
<p>"He is dead, no doubt," some one replied; "we no longer hear his laugh."</p>
<p>The King of Thunes frowned: "So much the worse. There was a brave heart under that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ironmongery" property="schema:name">ironmongery</span>. And Master <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span>?"</p>
<p>"Captain <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>," said Andry the Red, "he slipped away before we reached the Pont-aux-Changeurs."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span> stamped his foot. "Gueule-Dieu! '<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/TWAS" property="schema:name">twas</span> he who pushed us on hither, and he has deserted us in the very middle of the job! Cowardly chatterer, with a slipper for a helmet!"</p>
<p>"Captain <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>," said Andry the Red, who was gazing down Rue du Parvis, "yonder is the little scholar."</p>
<p>"Praised be <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pluto" property="schema:name">Pluto</span>!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>. "But what the devil is he dragging after him?"</p>
<p>It was, in fact, Jehan, who was running as fast as his heavy outfit of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paladin" property="schema:name">Paladin</span>, and a long ladder which trailed on the pavement, would permit, more <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathless_(1960_film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">breathless</span> than an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ant" property="schema:name">ant</span> harnessed to a blade of grass twenty times longer than itself.</p>
<p>"Victory! <i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Te_Deum" property="schema:name">Te Deum</span></i>!" cried the scholar. "Here is the ladder of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stevedore" property="schema:name">longshoremen</span> of Port Saint-Landry."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span> approached him.</p>
<p>"Child, what do you mean to do, <i>corne-dieu</i>! with this ladder?"</p>
<p>"I have it," replied Jehan, panting. "I knew where it was under the shed of the lieutenant's house. There's a wench there whom I know, who thinks me as handsome as Cupido. I made use of her to get the ladder, and I have the ladder, <i>Pasque-Mahom</i>! The poor girl came to open the door to me in her shift."</p>
<p>"Yes," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>, "but what are you going to do with that ladder?"</p>
<p>Jehan gazed at him with a malicious, knowing look, and cracked his fingers like <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castanets" property="schema:name">castanets</span>. At that moment he was sublime. On his head he wore one of those overloaded helmets of the fifteenth century, which frightened the enemy with their fanciful crests. His bristled with ten <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> beaks, so that Jehan could have disputed with Nestor's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Homeric</span> vessel the redoubtable title of <i>dexeubolos</i>.</p>
<p>"What do I mean to do with it, august king of Thunes? Do you see that row of statues which have such idiotic expressions, yonder, above the three portals?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Well?"</p>
<p>"'Tis the gallery of the kings of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>."</p>
<p>"What is that to me?" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>.</p>
<p>"Wait! At the end of that gallery there is a door which is never fastened otherwise than with a latch, and with this ladder I ascend, and I am in the church."</p>
<p>"Child let me be the first to ascend."</p>
<p>"No, comrade, the ladder is mine. Come, you shall be the second."</p>
<p>"May <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beelzebub" property="schema:name">Beelzebub</span> strangle you!" said surly <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>, "I won't be second to anybody."</p>
<p>"Then find a ladder, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>!"</p>
<p>Jehan set out on a run across the Place, dragging his ladder and shouting: "Follow me, lads!"</p>
<p>In an instant the ladder was raised, and propped against the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span> of the lower gallery, above one of the lateral doors. The throng of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span>, uttering loud acclamations, crowded to its foot to ascend. But Jehan maintained his right, and was the first to set foot on the rungs. The passage was tolerably long. The gallery of the kings of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span> is to-day about sixty feet above the pavement. The eleven steps of the flight before the door, made it still higher. Jehan mounted slowly, a good deal incommoded by his heavy armor, holding his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crossbow" property="schema:name">crossbow</span> in one hand, and clinging to a rung with the other. When he reached the middle of the ladder, he cast a melancholy glance at the poor dead outcasts, with which the steps were strewn. "Alas!" said he, "here is a heap of bodies worthy of the fifth book of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iliad" property="schema:name">Iliad</span>!" Then he continued his ascent. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span> followed him. There was one on every rung. At the sight of this line of cuirassed backs, undulating as they rose through the gloom, one would have pronounced it a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Snake" property="schema:name">serpent</span> with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steel" property="schema:name">steel</span> scales, which was raising itself erect in front of the church. Jehan who formed the head, and who was whistling, completed the illusion.</p>
<p>The scholar finally reached the balcony of the gallery, and climbed over it nimbly, to the applause of the whole vagabond tribe. Thus master of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Citadel" property="schema:name">citadel</span>, he uttered a shout of joy, and suddenly halted, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petrifaction" property="schema:name">petrified</span>. He had just caught sight of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> concealed in the dark, with flashing eye, behind one of the statues of the kings.</p>
<p>Before a second assailant could gain a foothold on the gallery, the formidable hunchback leaped to the head of the ladder, without uttering a word, seized the ends of the two uprights with his powerful hands, raised them, pushed them out from the wall, balanced the long and pliant ladder, loaded with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span> from top to bottom for a moment, in the midst of shrieks of anguish, then suddenly, with superhuman <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span>, hurled this cluster of men backward into the Place. There was a moment when even the most resolute trembled. The ladder, launched backwards, remained erect and standing for an instant, and seemed to hesitate, then wavered, then suddenly, describing a frightful arc of a circle eighty feet in radius, crashed upon the pavement with its load of ruffians, more rapidly than a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drawbridge" property="schema:name">drawbridge</span> when its chains break. There arose an immense imprecation, then all was still, and a few mutilated wretches were seen, crawling over the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory_management" property="schema:name">heap</span> of dead.</p>
<p>A sound of wrath and grief followed the first cries of triumph among the besiegers. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, impassive, with both elbows propped on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span>, looked on. He had the air of an old, bushy-headed king at his window.</p>
<p>As for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Jehan Frollo</span>, he was in a critical position. He found himself in the gallery with the formidable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span>, alone, separated from his companions by a vertical wall eighty feet high. While <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was dealing with the ladder, the scholar had run to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Postern" property="schema:name">postern</span> which he believed to be open. It was not. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man had closed it behind him when he entered the gallery. Jehan had then concealed himself behind a stone king, not daring to breathe, and fixing upon the monstrous hunchback a frightened gaze, like the man, who, when courting the wife of the guardian of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Menagerie" property="schema:name">menagerie</span>, went one evening to a love rendezvous, mistook the wall which he was to climb, and suddenly found himself face to face with a white <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bear" property="schema:name">bear</span>.</p>
<p>For the first few moments, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man paid no heed to him; but at last he turned his head, and suddenly straightened up. He had just caught sight of the scholar.</p>
<p>Jehan prepared himself for a rough shock, but the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man remained motionless; only he had turned towards the scholar and was looking at him.</p>
<p>"Ho ho!" said Jehan, "what do you mean by staring at me with that solitary and melancholy eye?"</p>
<p>As he spoke thus, the young scamp stealthily adjusted his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crossbow" property="schema:name">crossbow</span>.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>!" he cried, "I am going to change your surname: you shall be called the blind man."</p>
<p>The shot sped. The feathered vireton* whizzed and entered the hunchback's left arm. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> appeared no more moved by it than by a scratch to King Pharamond. He laid his hand on the arrow, tore it from his arm, and tranquilly broke it across his big knee; then he let the two pieces drop on the floor, rather than threw them down. But Jehan had no opportunity to fire a second time. The arrow broken, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> breathing heavily, bounded like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grasshopper" property="schema:name">grasshopper</span>, and he fell upon the scholar, whose armor was flattened against the wall by the blow.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  An arrow with a pyramidal head of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copper" property="schema:name">copper</span> spiral wings by<br/>which a rotatory motion was communicated.<br/></div>
<p>Then in that gloom, wherein wavered the light of the torches, a terrible thing was seen.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had grasped with his left hand the two arms of Jehan, who did not offer any resistance, so thoroughly did he feel that he was lost. With his right hand, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man detached one by one, in silence, with sinister slowness, all the pieces of his armor, the sword, the daggers, the helmet, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cuirass" property="schema:name">cuirass</span>, the leg pieces. One would have said that it was a monkey taking the shell from a nut. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> flung the scholar's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> shell at his feet, piece by piece. When the scholar beheld himself disarmed, stripped, weak, and naked in those terrible hands, he made no attempt to speak to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man, but began to laugh audaciously in his face, and to sing with his intrepid heedlessness of a child of sixteen, the then popular ditty:—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">         "<i><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elle_(magazine)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">Elle</span> est bien habillée,<br/>         La ville de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambrai" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Cambrai</span>;<br/>         Marafin l'a pillée</i>..."*<br/></div>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     * The city of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambrai" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Cambrai</span> is well dressed.  Marafin plundered it.<br/></div>
<p>He did not finish. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was seen on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parapet" property="schema:name">parapet</span> of the gallery, holding the scholar by the feet with one hand and whirling him over the abyss like a sling; then a sound like that of a bony structure in contact with a wall was heard, and something was seen to fall which halted a third of the way down in its fall, on a projection in the architecture. It was a dead body which remained hanging there, bent double, its loins broken, its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_skull" property="schema:name">skull</span> empty.</p>
<p>A cry of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horror_film" property="schema:name">horror</span> rose among the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span>.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/WWE_Night_of_Champions" property="schema:name">Vengeance</span>!" shouted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin</span>. "To the sack!" replied the multitude. "Assault! assault!"</p>
<p>There came a tremendous howl, in which were mingled all tongues, all dialects, all accents. The death of the poor scholar imparted a furious ardor to that crowd. It was seized with shame, and the wrath of having been held so long in check before a church by a hunchback. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rage_(band)" property="schema:name">Rage</span> found ladders, multiplied the torches, and, at the expiration of a few minutes, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, in despair, beheld that terrible <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ant" property="schema:name">ant</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory_management" property="schema:name">heap</span> mount on all sides to the assault of Notre-Dame. Those who had no ladders had knotted ropes; those who had no ropes climbed by the projections of the carvings. They hung from each other's rags. There were no means of resisting that rising tide of frightful faces; rage made these fierce countenances ruddy; their clayey brows were dripping with sweat; their eyes darted lightnings; all these grimaces, all these horrors laid siege to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. One would have said that some other church had despatched to the assault of Notre-Dame its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gorgon" property="schema:name">gorgons</span>, its dogs, its drées, its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demon" property="schema:name">demons</span>, its most fantastic sculptures. It was like a layer of living monsters on the stone monsters of the façade.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Place was studded with a thousand torches. This scene of confusion, till now hid in darkness, was suddenly flooded with light. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parvise" property="schema:name">parvis</span> was resplendent, and cast a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radiance" property="schema:name">radiance</span> on the sky; the bonfire lighted on the lofty platform was still burning, and illuminated the city far away. The enormous silhouette of the two towers, projected <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afar_people" property="schema:name">afar</span> on the roofs of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, and formed a large notch of black in this light. The city seemed to be aroused. Alarm bells wailed in the distance. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span> howled, panted, swore, climbed; and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, powerless against so many enemies, shuddering for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, beholding the furious faces approaching ever nearer and nearer to his gallery, entreated heaven for a miracle, and wrung his arms in despair.</p>

<p>The reader has not, perhaps, forgotten that one moment before catching sight of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nocturnality" property="schema:name">nocturnal</span> band of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, as he inspected <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> from the heights of his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">bell tower</span>, perceived only one light burning, which gleamed like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Star" property="schema:name">star</span> from a window on the topmost story of a lofty edifice beside the Porte Saint-Antoine. This edifice was the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution" property="schema:name">Bastille</span>. That <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Star" property="schema:name">star</span> was the candle of Louis XI. King <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. had, in fact, been two days in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>. He was to take his departure on the next day but one for his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Citadel" property="schema:name">citadel</span> of Montilz-les-Tours. He made but seldom and brief appearance in his good city of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, since there he did not feel about him enough pitfalls, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbets</span>, and Scotch archers.</p>
<p>He had come, that day, to sleep at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution" property="schema:name">Bastille</span>. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_chamber" property="schema:name">great chamber</span> five <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toise" property="schema:name">toises</span>* square, which he had at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Louvre" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Louvre</span>, with its huge chimney-piece loaded with twelve <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Beasts" property="schema:name">great beasts</span> and thirteen great prophets, and his grand bed, eleven feet by twelve, pleased him but little. He felt himself lost amid all this grandeur. This good <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> king preferred the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution" property="schema:name">Bastille</span> with a tiny chamber and couch. And then, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution" property="schema:name">Bastille</span> was stronger than the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Louvre" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Louvre</span>.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  An ancient long measure in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>, containing six feet<br/>and nearly five inches <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">English</span> measure.<br/></div>
<p>This little chamber, which the king reserved for himself in the famous state prison, was also tolerably spacious and occupied the topmost story of a turret rising from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keep" property="schema:name">donjon</span> keep. It was circular in form, carpeted with mats of shining straw, ceiled with beams, enriched with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">fleurs-de-lis</span> of gilded metal with interjoists in color; wainscoated with rich woods sown with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rose_window" property="schema:name">rosettes</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nickel" property="schema:name">white metal</span>, and with others painted a fine, bright green, made of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orpiment" property="schema:name">orpiment</span> and fine <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indigo" property="schema:name">indigo</span>.</p>
<p>There was only one window, a long pointed casement, latticed with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brass" property="schema:name">brass</span> wire and bars of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wrought_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span>, further darkened by fine colored panes with the arms of the king and of the queen, each pane being worth two and twenty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span>.</p>
<p>There was but one entrance, a modern door, with a fiat arch, garnished with a piece of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tapestry" property="schema:name">tapestry</span> on the inside, and on the outside by one of those porches of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ireland" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Irish</span> wood, frail edifices of cabinet-work curiously wrought, numbers of which were still to be seen in old houses a hundred and fifty years ago. "Although they disfigure and embarrass the places," says Sauvel in despair, "our old people are still unwilling to get rid of them, and keep them in spite of everybody."</p>
<p>In this chamber, nothing was to be found of what furnishes ordinary apartments, neither benches, nor trestles, nor forms, nor common stools in the form of a chest, nor fine stools sustained by pillars and counter-pillars, at four <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span> a piece. Only one easy arm-chair, very magnificent, was to be seen; the wood was painted with roses on a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> ground, the seat was of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ruby" property="schema:name">ruby</span> Cordovan leather, ornamented with long silken fringes, and studded with a thousand golden <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nail_(fastener)" property="schema:name">nails</span>. The loneliness of this chair made it apparent that only one person had a right to sit down in this apartment. Beside the chair, and quite close to the window, there was a table covered with a cloth with a pattern of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">birds</span>. On this table stood an inkhorn spotted with ink, some parchments, several pens, and a large goblet of chased silver. A little further on was a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brass" property="schema:name">brazier</span>, a praying stool in crimson velvet, relieved with small bosses of gold. Finally, at the extreme end of the room, a simple bed of scarlet and yellow <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Damask" property="schema:name">damask</span>, without either tinsel or <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lace" property="schema:name">lace</span>; having only an ordinary fringe. This bed, famous for having borne the sleep or the sleeplessness of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>., was still to be seen two hundred years ago, at the house of a councillor of state, where it was seen by old Madame Pilou, celebrated in <i>Cyrus</i> under the name "Arricidie" and of "la Morale Vivante".</p>
<p>Such was the chamber which was called "the retreat where Monsieur Louis de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span> says his prayers."</p>
<p>At the moment when we have introduced the reader into it, this retreat was very dark. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Curfew_bell" property="schema:name">curfew bell</span> had sounded an hour before; night was come, and there was only one flickering <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wax" property="schema:name">wax</span> candle set on the table to light five persons variously grouped in the chamber.</p>
<p>The first on which the light fell was a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord" property="schema:name">seigneur</span> superbly clad in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breeches" property="schema:name">breeches</span> and jerkin of scarlet striped with silver, and a loose coat with half sleeves of cloth of gold with black figures. This splendid costume, on which the light played, seemed glazed with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flame" property="schema:name">flame</span> on every fold. The man who wore it had his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coat_of_arms" property="schema:name">armorial bearings</span> embroidered on his breast in vivid colors; a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chevron_(insignia)" property="schema:name">chevron</span> accompanied by a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deer" property="schema:name">deer</span> passant. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shield" property="schema:name">shield</span> was flanked, on the right by an olive branch, on the left by a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deer" property="schema:name">deer</span>'s <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antler" property="schema:name">antlers</span>. This man wore in his girdle a rich <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dagger" typeof="schema:Product" property="schema:name">dagger</span> whose <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sword" property="schema:name">hilt</span>, of silver gilt, was chased in the form of a helmet, and surmounted by a count's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coronet" property="schema:name">coronet</span>. He had a forbidding air, a proud <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yao_people" property="schema:name">mien</span>, and a head held high. At the first glance one read arrogance on his visage; at the second, craft.</p>
<p>He was standing bareheaded, a long roll of parchment in his hand, behind the arm-chair in which was seated, his body ungracefully doubled up, his knees crossed, his elbow on the table, a very badly accoutred personage. Let the reader imagine in fact, on the rich seat of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Córdoba,_Andalusia" property="schema:name">Cordova</span> leather, two crooked knees, two thin thighs, poorly clad in black worsted tricot, a body enveloped in a cloak of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fustian" property="schema:name">fustian</span>, with fur trimming of which more leather than hair was visible; lastly, to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span> all, a greasy old hat of the worst sort of black cloth, bordered with a circular string of leaden figures. This, in company with a dirty skull-cap, which hardly allowed a hair to escape, was all that distinguished the seated personage. He held his head so bent upon his breast, that nothing was to be seen of his face thus thrown into shadow, except the tip of his nose, upon which fell a ray of light, and which must have been long. From the thinness of his wrinkled hand, one divined that he was an old man. It was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. At some distance behind them, two men dressed in garments of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemish</span> style were conversing, who were not sufficiently lost in the shadow to prevent any one who had been present at the performance of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>'s mystery from recognizing in them two of the principal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemish</span> envoys, Guillaume Rym, the sagacious pensioner of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghent" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Ghent</span>, and Jacques Coppenole, the popular <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span>. The reader will remember that these men were mixed up in the secret politics of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. Finally, quite at the end of the room, near the door, in the dark, stood, motionless as a statue, a vigorous man with thickset limbs, a military harness, with a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surcoat" property="schema:name">surcoat</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coat_of_arms" property="schema:name">armorial bearings</span>, whose square face pierced with staring eyes, slit with an immense mouth, his ears concealed by two large screens of flat hair, had something about it both of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">dog</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiger" property="schema:name">tiger</span>.</p>
<p>All were uncovered except the king.</p>
<p>The gentleman who stood near the king was reading him a sort of long memorial to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Women's_Health_Initiative" property="schema:name">whi</span>ch his majesty seemed to be listening attentively. The two <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flemish_people" property="schema:name">Flemings</span> were whispering together.</p>
<p>"Cross of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>!" grumbled Coppenole, "I am tired of standing; is there no chair here?"</p>
<p>Rym replied by a negative gesture, accompanied by a discreet smile.</p>
<p>"Croix-Dieu!" resumed Coppenole, thoroughly unhappy at being obliged to lower his voice thus, "I should like to sit down on the floor, with my legs crossed, like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span>, as I do in my shop."</p>
<p>"Take good care that you do not, Master Jacques."</p>
<p>"Ouais! Master Guillaume! can one only remain here on his feet?"</p>
<p>"Or on his knees," said Rym.</p>
<p>At that moment the king's voice was uplifted. They held their peace.</p>
<p>"Fifty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span> for the robes of our <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Valet" property="schema:name">valets</span>, and twelve <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_livre" property="schema:name">livres</span> for the mantles of the clerks of our <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span>! That's it! Pour out gold by the ton! Are you mad, Olivier?"</p>
<p>As he spoke thus, the old man raised his head. The golden shells of the collar of Saint-Michael could be seen gleaming on his neck. The candle fully illuminated his gaunt and morose profile. He tore the papers from the other's hand.</p>
<p>"You are ruining us!" he cried, casting his hollow eyes over the scroll. "What is all this? What need have we of so prodigious a household? Two chaplains at ten <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_livre" property="schema:name">livres</span> a month each, and, a chapel clerk at one hundred <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span>! A valet-de-chambre at ninety <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_livre" property="schema:name">livres</span> a year. Four head cooks at six score <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_livre" property="schema:name">livres</span> a year each! A spit-cook, an herb-cook, a sauce-cook, a butler, two sumpter-horse lackeys, at ten <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_livre" property="schema:name">livres</span> a month each! Two scullions at eight <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span>! A groom of the stables and his two aids at four and twenty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span> a month! A porter, a pastry-cook, a baker, two carters, each sixty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span> a year! And the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Farrier" property="schema:name">farrier</span> six score <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span>! And the master of the chamber of our funds, twelve hundred <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span>! And the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Comptroller" property="schema:name">comptroller</span> five hundred. And how do I know what else? 'Tis ruinous. The wages of our servants are putting <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span> to the pillage! All the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ingot" property="schema:name">ingots</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Louvre" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Louvre</span> will melt before such a fire of expenses! We shall have to sell our plate! And next year, if <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> and our Lady (here he raised his hat) lend us life, we shall drink our potions from a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pewter" property="schema:name">pewter</span> pot!"</p>
<p>So saying, he cast a glance at the silver goblet which gleamed upon the table. He coughed and continued,—</p>
<p>"Master Olivier, the princes who reign over great lordships, like kings and emperors, should not allow sumptuousness in their houses; for the fire spreads thence through the province. Hence, Master Olivier, consider this said once for all. Our expenditure increases every year. The thing displease us. How, <i>pasque-Dieu</i>! when in '79 it did not exceed six and thirty thousand <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span>, did it attain in '80, forty-three thousand six hundred and nineteen <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span>? I have the figures in my head. In '81, sixty-six thousand six hundred and eighty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span>, and this year, by the faith of my body, it will reach eighty thousand <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span>! Doubled in four years! Monstrous!"</p>
<p>He paused <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathless_(1960_film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">breathless</span>, then resumed energetically,—</p>
<p>"I behold around me only people who fatten on my leanness! you suck crowns from me at every pore."</p>
<p>All remained <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span>. This was one of those fits of wrath which are allowed to take their course. He continued,—</p>
<p>"'Tis like that request in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span> from the gentlemen of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>, that we should re-establish what they call the grand charges of the Crown! Charges in very deed! Charges which crush! Ah! gentlemen! you say that we are not a king to reign <i>dapifero nullo, buticulario nullo</i>! We will let you see, <i>pasque-Dieu</i>! whether we are not a king!"</p>
<p>Here he smiled, in the consciousness of his power; this softened his bad humor, and he turned towards the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemings</span>,—</p>
<p>"Do you see, Gossip Guillaume? the grand warden of the keys, the grand butler, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chamberlain_(office)" property="schema:name">grand chamberlain</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seneschal" property="schema:name">grand seneschal</span> are not worth the smallest <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Valet" property="schema:name">valet</span>. Remember this, Gossip Coppenole. They serve no purpose, as they stand thus useless round the king; they produce upon me the effect of the four Evangelists who surround the face of the big clock of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace_of_Versailles" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">palace</span>, and which Philippe Brille has just set in order afresh. They are gilt, but they do not indicate the hour; and the hands can get on without them."</p>
<p>He remained in thought for a moment, then added, shaking his aged head,—</p>
<p>"Ho! ho! by our Lady, I am not Philippe Brille, and I shall not gild the great vassals anew. Continue, Olivier."</p>
<p>The person whom he designated by this name, took the papers into his hands again, and began to read aloud,—</p>
<p>"To <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adam_and_Eve" property="schema:name">Adam</span> Tenon, clerk of the warden of the seals of the provostship of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>; for the silver, making, and engraving of said seals, which have been made new because the others preceding, by reason of their antiquity and their worn condition, could no longer be successfully used, twelve livres parisis.</p>
<p>"To Guillaume Frère, the sum of four <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span>, four <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span> parisis, for his trouble and salary, for having nourished and fed the doves in the two dove-cots of the Hôtel des Tournelles, during the months of January, February, and March of this year; and for this he hath given seven sextiers of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" property="schema:name">barley</span>.</p>
<p>"To a gray <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominican_Order" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">friar</span> for confessing a criminal, four <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span> parisis."</p>
<p>The king listened in silence. From time to time he coughed; then he raised the goblet to his lips and drank a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ox" property="schema:name">draught</span> with a grimace.</p>
<p>"During this year there have been made by the ordinance of justice, to the sound of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trumpet" property="schema:name">trumpet</span>, through the squares of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, fifty-six proclamations. Account to be regulated.</p>
<p>"For having searched and ransacked in certain places, in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> as well as elsewhere, for money said to be there concealed; but nothing hath been found: forty-five livres parisis."</p>
<p>"Bury a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span> to unearth a sou!" said the king.</p>
<p>"For having set in the Hôtel des Tournelles six panes of white glass in the place where the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> cage is, thirteen <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span>; for having made and delivered by command of the king, on the day of the musters, four shields with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Escutcheon_(heraldry)" property="schema:name">escutcheons</span> of the said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fee_(feudal_tenure)" property="schema:name">seigneur</span>, encircled with garlands of roses all about, six <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span>; for two new sleeves to the king's old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doublet_(clothing)" property="schema:name">doublet</span>, twenty sols; for a box of grease to grease the boots of the king, fifteen deniers; a stable newly made to lodge the king's black <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wild_boar" property="schema:name">pigs</span>, thirty livres parisis; many partitions, planks, and trap-doors, for the safekeeping of the lions at Saint-Paul, twenty-two <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span>."</p>
<p>"These be dear beasts," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. "It matters not; it is a fine magnificence in a king. There is a great <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pub_names" property="schema:name">red lion</span> whom I love for his pleasant ways. Have you seen him, Master Guillaume? Princes must have these terrific animals; for we kings must have lions for our dogs and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiger" property="schema:name">tigers</span> for our cats. The great befits a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span>. In the days of the pagans of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>, when the people offered the temples a hundred <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ox" property="schema:name">oxen</span> and a hundred <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sheep" property="schema:name">sheep</span>, the emperors gave a hundred lions and a hundred <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eagle" property="schema:name">eagles</span>. This was wild and very fine. The kings of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span> have always had roarings round their throne. Nevertheless, people must do me this justice, that I spend still less money on it than they did, and that I possess a greater modesty of lions, bears, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elephant" property="schema:name">elephants</span>, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leopard" property="schema:name">leopards</span>.—Go on, Master Olivier. We wished to say thus much to our <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemish</span> friends."</p>
<p>Guillaume Rym bowed low, while Coppenole, with his surly <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yao_people" property="schema:name">mien</span>, had the air of one of the bears of which his majesty was speaking. The king paid no heed. He had just dipped his lips into the goblet, and he spat out the beverage, saying: "Foh! what a disagreeable potion!" The man who was reading continued:—</p>
<p>"For feeding a rascally footpad, locked up these six months in the little cell of the flayer, until it should be determined what to do with him, six <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_livre" property="schema:name">livres</span>, four <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span>."</p>
<p>"What's that?" interrupted the king; "feed what ought to be hanged! <i>Pasque-Dieu</i>! I will give not a sou more for that nourishment. Olivier, come to an understanding about the matter with Monsieur d'Estouteville, and prepare me this very evening the wedding of the gallant and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallows" property="schema:name">gallows</span>. Resume."</p>
<p>Olivier made a mark with his thumb against the article of the "rascally foot soldier," and passed on.</p>
<p>"To Henriet Cousin, master executor of the high works of justice in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, the sum of sixty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span> parisis, to him assessed and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Orders" property="schema:name">ordained</span> by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monsignor" property="schema:name">monseigneur</span> the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(religion)" property="schema:name">provost</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, for having bought, by order of the said sieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(religion)" property="schema:name">provost</span>, a great broad sword, serving to execute and decapitate persons who are by justice condemned for their demerits, and he hath caused the same to be garnished with a sheath and with all things thereto appertaining; and hath likewise caused to be repointed and set in order the old sword, which had become broken and notched in executing justice on Messire Louis de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luxembourg" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Luxembourg</span>, as will more fully appear."</p>
<p>The king interrupted: "That suffices. I allow the sum with great good will. Those are expenses which I do not begrudge. I have never regretted that money. Continue."</p>
<p>"For having made over a great cage..."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said the king, grasping the arms of his chair in both hands, "I knew well that I came hither to this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution" property="schema:name">Bastille</span> for some purpose. Hold, Master Olivier; I desire to see that cage myself. You shall read me the cost while I am examining it. Messieurs <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemings</span>, come and see this; 'tis curious."</p>
<p>Then he rose, leaned on the arm of his interlocutor, made a sign to the sort of mute who stood before the door to precede him, to the two <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemings</span> to follow him, and quitted the room.</p>
<p>The royal company was recruited, at the door of the retreat, by men of arms, all loaded down with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wrought_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span>, and by slender pages bearing <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Orleans_Mardi_Gras" property="schema:name">flambeaux</span>. It marched for some time through the interior of the gloomy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keep" property="schema:name">donjon</span>, pierced with staircases and corridors even in the very thickness of the walls. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution" property="schema:name">Bastille</span> marched at their head, and caused the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wicket" property="schema:name">wickets</span> to be opened before the bent and aged king, who coughed as he walked.</p>
<p>At each wicket, all heads were obliged to stoop, except that of the old man bent double with age. "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zachlumia" property="schema:name">Hum</span>," said he between his gums, for he had no longer any teeth, "we are already quite prepared for the door of the sepulchre. For a low door, a bent passer."</p>
<p>At length, after having passed a final wicket, so loaded with locks that a quarter of an hour was required to open it, they entered a vast and lofty vaulted hall, in the centre of which they could distinguish by the light of the torches, a huge cubic mass of masonry, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wrought_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span>, and wood. The interior was hollow. It was one of those famous cages of prisoners of state, which were called "the little daughters of the king." In its walls there were two or three little windows so closely <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trellis_(architecture)" property="schema:name">trellised</span> with stout <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wrought_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> bars; that the glass was not visible. The door was a large flat slab of stone, as on tombs; the sort of door which serves for entrance only. Only here, the occupant was alive.</p>
<p>The king began to walk slowly round the little edifice, examining it carefully, while Master Olivier, who followed him, read aloud the note.</p>
<p>"For having made a great cage of wood of solid beams, timbers and wall-plates, measuring nine feet in length by eight in breadth, and of the height of seven feet between the partitions, smoothed and clamped with great bolts of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cast_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span>, which has been placed in a chamber situated in one of the towers of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution" property="schema:name">Bastille</span> Saint-Antoine, in which cage is placed and detained, by command of the king our lord, a prisoner who formerly inhabited an old, decrepit, and ruined cage. There have been employed in making the said new cage, ninety-six horizontal beams, and fifty-two upright <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joist" property="schema:name">joists</span>, ten wall plates three <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toise" property="schema:name">toises</span> long; there have been occupied nineteen carpenters to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">hew</span>, work, and fit all the said wood in the courtyard of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution" property="schema:name">Bastille</span> during twenty days."</p>
<p>"Very fine heart of oak," said the king, striking the woodwork with his fist.</p>
<p>"There have been used in this cage," continued the other, "two hundred and twenty great bolts of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cast_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span>, of nine feet, and of eight, the rest of medium length, with the rowels, caps and counterbands appertaining to the said bolts; weighing, the said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cast_iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> in all, three thousand, seven hundred and thirty-five pounds; beside eight great squares of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span>, serving to attach the said cage in place with clamps and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nail_(fastener)" property="schema:name">nails</span> weighing in all two hundred and eighteen pounds, not reckoning the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trellis_(architecture)" property="schema:name">trellises</span> for the windows of the chamber wherein the cage hath been placed, the bars of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> for the door of the cage and other things."</p>
<p>"'Tis a great deal of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span>," said the king, "to contain the light of a spirit."</p>
<p>"The whole amounts to three hundred and seventeen <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span>, five <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span>, seven deniers."</p>
<p>"<i>Pasque-Dieu</i>!" exclaimed the king.</p>
<p>At this oath, which was the favorite of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>., some one seemed to awaken in the interior of the cage; the sound of chains was heard, grating on the floor, and a feeble voice, which seemed to issue from the tomb was uplifted. "Sire! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" property="schema:name">sire</span>! mercy!" The one who spoke thus could not be seen.</p>
<p>"Three hundred and seventeen <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span>, five <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span>, seven deniers," repeated Louis XI. The lamentable voice which had proceeded from the cage had frozen all present, even Master Olivier himself. The king alone wore the air of not having heard. At his order, Master Olivier resumed his reading, and his majesty coldly continued his inspection of the cage.</p>
<p>"In addition to this there hath been paid to a mason who hath made the holes wherein to place the gratings of the windows, and the floor of the chamber where the cage is, because that floor could not support this cage by reason of its weight, twenty-seven <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span> fourteen <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span> parisis."</p>
<p>The voice began to moan again.</p>
<p>"Mercy, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" property="schema:name">sire</span>! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Swear" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">I swear</span> to you that '<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/TWAS" property="schema:name">twas</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mons" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Mons</span>ieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">Cardinal</span> d'Angers and not I, who was guilty of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treason" property="schema:name">treason</span>."</p>
<p>"The mason is bold!" said the king. "Continue, Olivier." Olivier continued,—</p>
<p>"To a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joiner" property="schema:name">joiner</span> for window frames, bedstead, hollow stool, and other things, twenty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_livre" property="schema:name">livres</span>, two <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span> parisis."</p>
<p>The voice also continued.</p>
<p>"Alas, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" property="schema:name">sire</span>! will you not listen to me? I protest to you that '<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/TWAS" property="schema:name">twas</span> not I who wrote the matter to Monseigneur do <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guyenne" property="schema:name">Guyenne</span>, but Monsieur le <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">Cardinal</span> Balue."</p>
<p>"The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joiner" property="schema:name">joiner</span> is dear," quoth the king. "Is that all?"</p>
<p>"No, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" property="schema:name">sire</span>. To a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glazier" property="schema:name">glazier</span>, for the windows of the said chamber, forty-six <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span>, eight deniers parisis."</p>
<p>"Have mercy, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" property="schema:name">sire</span>! Is it not enough to have given all my goods to my judges, my plate to Monsieur de Torcy, my library to Master Pierre Doriolle, my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tapestry" property="schema:name">tapestry</span> to the governor of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roussillon" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Roussillon</span>? I am innocent. I have been shivering in an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> cage for fourteen years. Have mercy, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" property="schema:name">sire</span>! You will find your reward in heaven."</p>
<p>"Master Olivier," said the king, "the total?"</p>
<p>"Three hundred sixty-seven <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_livre" property="schema:name">livres</span>, eight <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span>, three deniers parisis.</p>
<p>"Notre-Dame!" cried the king. "This is an outrageous cage!"</p>
<p>He tore the book from Master Olivier's hands, and set to reckoning it himself upon his fingers, examining the paper and the cage alternately. Meanwhile, the prisoner could be heard sobbing. This was lugubrious in the darkness, and their faces turned pale as they looked at each other.</p>
<p>"Fourteen years, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" property="schema:name">sire</span>! Fourteen years now! since the month of April, 1469. In the name of the Holy Mother of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" property="schema:name">sire</span>, listen to me! During all this time you have enjoyed the heat of the sun. Shall I, frail creature, never more behold the day? Mercy, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>! Be pitiful! Clemency is a fine, royal virtue, which turns aside the currents of wrath. Does your majesty believe that in the hour of death it will be a great cause of content for a king never to have left any offence unpunished? Besides, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>, I did not betray your majesty, '<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/TWAS" property="schema:name">twas</span> Monsieur d'Angers; and I have on my foot a very heavy chain, and a great ball of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> at the end, much heavier than it should be in reason. Eh! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>! Have pity on me!"</p>
<p>"Olivier," cried the king, throwing back his head, "I observe that they charge me twenty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span> a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hogshead" property="schema:name">hogshead</span> for plaster, while it is worth but twelve. You will refer back this account."</p>
<p>He turned his back on the cage, and set out to leave the room. The miserable prisoner divined from the removal of the torches and the noise, that the king was taking his departure.</p>
<p>"Sire! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>!" he cried in despair.</p>
<p>The door closed again. He no longer saw anything, and heard only the hoarse voice of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prison_officer" property="schema:name">turnkey</span>, singing in his ears this ditty,—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">         "<i>Maître Jean Balue,<br/>         A perdu la vue<br/>         De <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Social_class" property="schema:name">ses</span> évêchés.<br/>         Monsieur de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Verdun" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Verdun</span>.<br/>         N'en a plus pas un;<br/>         Tous sont dépêchés</i>."*<br/></div>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     * Master Jean Balue has lost sight of his bishoprics.<br/>Monsieur of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Verdun" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Verdun</span> has no longer one; all have been killed off.<br/></div>
<p>The king reascended in silence to his retreat, and his suite followed him, terrified by the last groans of the condemned man. All at once his majesty turned to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Governor" property="schema:name">Governor</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution" property="schema:name">Bastille</span>,—</p>
<p>"By the way," said he, "was there not some one in that cage?"</p>
<p>"Pardieu, yes <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>!" replied the governor, astounded by the question.</p>
<p>"And who was it?"</p>
<p>"Monsieur the Bishop of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Verdun" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Verdun</span>."</p>
<p>The king knew this better than any one else. But it was a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mania" property="schema:name">mania</span> of his.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said he, with the innocent air of thinking of it for the first time, "Guillaume de Harancourt, the friend of Monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">Cardinal</span> Balue. A good devil of a bishop!"</p>
<p>At the expiration of a few moments, the door of the retreat had opened again, then closed upon the five personages whom the reader has seen at the beginning of this chapter, and who resumed their places, their whispered conversations, and their attitudes.</p>
<p>During the king's absence, several despatches had been placed on his table, and he broke the seals himself. Then he began to read them promptly, one after the other, made a sign to Master Olivier who appeared to exercise the office of minister, to take a pen, and without communicating to him the contents of the despatches, he began to dictate in a low voice, the replies which the latter wrote, on his knees, in an inconvenient attitude before the table.</p>
<p>Guillaume Rym was on the watch.</p>
<p>The king spoke so low that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemings</span> heard nothing of his dictation, except some isolated and rather unintelligible scraps, such as,—</p>
<p>"To maintain the fertile places by commerce, and the sterile by manufactures....—To show the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">English</span> lords our four <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bombard_(weapon)" property="schema:name">bombards</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">London</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Brabant" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Brabant</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourg-en-Bresse" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bourg-en-Bresse</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Omer" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Omer</span>....—Artillery is the cause of war being made more judiciously now....—To Monsieur de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bressuire" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bressuire</span>, our friend....—Armies cannot be maintained without tribute, etc."</p>
<p>Once he raised his voice,—</p>
<p>"<i>Pasque Dieu</i>! Monsieur the King of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Sicily" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Sicily</span> seals his letters with yellow <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wax" property="schema:name">wax</span>, like a king of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>. Perhaps we are in the wrong to permit him so to do. My fair cousin of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Burgundy" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Burgundy</span> granted no <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coat_of_arms" property="schema:name">armorial bearings</span> with a field of gules. The grandeur of houses is assured by the integrity of prerogatives. Note this, friend Olivier."</p>
<p>Again,—</p>
<p>"Oh! oh!" said he, "What a long message! What doth our brother the emperor claim?" And running his eye over the missive and breaking his reading with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interjection" property="schema:name">interjection</span>: "Surely! the Germans are so great and powerful, that it is hardly credible—But let us not forget the old proverb: 'The finest county is <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flanders</span>; the finest duchy, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Milan" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Milan</span>; the finest kingdom, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>.' Is it not so, Messieurs <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemings</span>?"</p>
<p>This time Coppenole bowed in company with Guillaume Rym. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span>'s patriotism was tickled.</p>
<p>The last despatch made <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. frown.</p>
<p>"What is this?" he said, "Complaints and fault finding against our garrisons in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Picardy" typeof="schema:AdministrativeArea" property="schema:name">Picardy</span>! Olivier, write with diligence to M. the Marshal de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georges_Rouault" property="schema:name">Rouault</span>:—That discipline is relaxed. That the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gendarme_(historical)" property="schema:name">gendarmes</span> of the unattached troops, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feudalism" property="schema:name">feudal</span> nobles, the free archers, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Swiss_mercenaries" property="schema:name">Swiss</span> inflict infinite evils on the rustics.—That the military, not content with what they find in the houses of the rustics, constrain them with violent blows of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Club_(weapon)" property="schema:name">cudgel</span> or of lash to go and get <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spice" property="schema:name">spices</span>, and other unreasonable things in the town.—That monsieur the king knows this. That we undertake to guard our people against inconveniences, larcenies and pillage.—That such is our will, by our Lady!—That in addition, it suits us not that any <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fiddle" property="schema:name">fiddler</span>, barber, or any soldier <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Valet_de_chambre" property="schema:name">varlet</span> should be clad like a prince, in velvet, cloth of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silk" property="schema:name">silk</span>, and rings of gold.—That these vanities are hateful to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>.—That we, who are gentlemen, content ourselves with a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doublet_(clothing)" property="schema:name">doublet</span> of cloth at sixteen <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span> the ell, of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>.—That messieurs the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Camp_follower" property="schema:name">camp-followers</span> can very well come down to that, also.—Command and ordain.—To Monsieur de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georges_Rouault" property="schema:name">Rouault</span>, our friend.—Good."</p>
<p>He dictated this letter aloud, in a firm tone, and in jerks. At the moment when he finished it, the door opened and gave passage to a new personage, who precipitated himself into the chamber, crying in affright,—</p>
<p>"Sire! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>! there is a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sedition" property="schema:name">sedition</span> of the populace in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>!" <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>.'s grave face contracted; but all that was visible of his emotion passed away like a flash of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lightning" property="schema:name">lightning</span>. He controlled himself and said with tranquil severity,—</p>
<p>"Gossip Jacques, you enter very abruptly!"</p>
<p>"Sire! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>! there is a revolt!" repeated Gossip Jacques breathlessly.</p>
<p>The king, who had risen, grasped him roughly by the arm, and said in his ear, in such a manner as to be heard by him alone, with concentrated rage and a sidelong glance at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemings</span>,—</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue! or speak low!"</p>
<p>The new comer understood, and began in a low tone to give a very terrified account, to which the king listened calmly, while Guillaume Rym called Coppenole's attention to the face and dress of the new arrival, to his furred <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cowl" property="schema:name">cowl</span>, (<i>caputia fourrata</i>), his short cape, (<i>epitogia curta</i>), his robe of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_Velvet_(song)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">black velvet</span>, which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bespoke" property="schema:name">bespoke</span> a president of the court of accounts.</p>
<p>Hardly had this personage given the king some explanations, when <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. exclaimed, bursting into a laugh,—</p>
<p>"In truth? Speak aloud, Gossip Coictier! What call is there for you to talk so low? Our Lady knoweth that we conceal nothing from our good friends the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemings</span>."</p>
<p>"But <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>..."</p>
<p>"Speak loud!"</p>
<p>Gossip Coictier was struck dumb with surprise.</p>
<p>"So," resumed the king,—"speak sir,—there is a commotion among the louts in our good city of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>?"</p>
<p>"Yes, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>."</p>
<p>"And which is moving you say, against monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> of the Palais-de-Justice?"</p>
<p>"So it appears," said the gossip, who still stammered, utterly astounded by the abrupt and inexplicable change which had just taken place in the king's thoughts.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. continued: "Where did the watch meet the rabble?"</p>
<p>"Marching from the Grand Truanderie, towards the Pont-aux-Changeurs. I met it myself as I was on my way hither to obey your majesty's commands. I heard some of them shouting: '<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/County_Down" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Down</span> with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace_of_Versailles" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">palace</span>!'"</p>
<p>"And what complaints have they against the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span>?"</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Gossip Jacques, "because he is their lord."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Yes, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>. They are knaves from the Cour-des-Miracles. They have been complaining this long while, of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span>, whose vassals they are. They do not wish to recognize him either as judge or as voyer?"*</p></body></html>
