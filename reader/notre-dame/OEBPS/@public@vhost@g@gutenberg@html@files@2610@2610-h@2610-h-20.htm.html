<p>"Yes, certainly!" retorted the king with a smile of satis-faction which he strove in vain to disguise.</p>
<p>"In all their petitions to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parliament_of_England" typeof="schema:Organization" property="schema:name">Parliament</span>, they claim to have but two masters. Your majesty and their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>, who is the devil, I believe."</p>
<p>"Eh! eh!" said the king.</p>
<p>He rubbed his hands, he laughed with that inward mirth which makes the countenance beam; he was unable to dissimulate his joy, although he endeavored at moments to compose himself. No one understood it in the least, not even Master Olivier. He remained <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span> for a moment, with a thoughtful but contented air.</p>
<p>"Are they in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span>?" he suddenly inquired.</p>
<p>"Yes, assuredly, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>," replied Gossip Jacques.</p>
<p>"How many?"</p>
<p>"Six thousand at the least."</p>
<p>The king could not refrain from saying: "Good!" he went on,—</p>
<p>"Are they armed?"</p>
<p>"With <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythe" property="schema:name">scythes</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pike_(weapon)" property="schema:name">pikes</span>, hackbuts, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pickaxe" property="schema:name">pickaxes</span>. All sorts of very violent weapons."</p>
<p>The king did not appear in the least disturbed by this list. Jacques considered it his duty to add,—</p>
<p>"If your majesty does not send prompt succor to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span>, he is lost."</p>
<p>"We will send," said the king with an air of false seriousness. "It is well. Assuredly we will send. Monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> is our friend. Six thousand! They are desperate scamps! Their audacity is marvellous, and we are greatly enraged at it. But we have only a few people about us to-night. To-morrow morning will be time enough."</p>
<p>Gossip Jacques exclaimed, "Instantly, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>! there will be time to sack the bailiwick a score of times, to violate the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manorialism" property="schema:name">seignory</span>, to hang the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span>. For <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>'s sake, sire! send before to-morrow morning."</p>
<p>The king looked him full in the face. "I have told you to-morrow morning."</p>
<p>It was one Of those looks to which one does not reply. After a silence, Louis XI. raised his voice once more,—</p>
<p>"You should know that, Gossip Jacques. What was—"</p>
<p>He corrected himself. "What is the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span>'s <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feudalism" property="schema:name">feudal</span> jurisdiction?"</p>
<p>"Sire, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace_of_Versailles" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">palace</span> has the Rue Calendre as far as the Rue de l'Herberie, the Place Saint-Michel, and the localities vulgarly known as the Mureaux, situated near the church of Notre-Dame des Champs (here <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. raised the brim of his hat), which hotels number thirteen, plus the Cour des Miracles, plus the Maladerie, called the Banlieue, plus the whole highway which begins at that Maladerie and ends at the Porte Sainte-Jacques. Of these divers places he is voyer, high, middle, and low, justiciary, full <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord" property="schema:name">seigneur</span>."</p>
<p>"Bless me!" said the king, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scratching" property="schema:name">scratching</span> his left ear with his right hand, "that makes a goodly bit of my city! Ah! monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> was king of all that."</p>
<p>This time he did not correct himself. He continued dreamily, and as though speaking to himself,—</p>
<p>"Very fine, monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span>! You had there between your teeth a pretty slice of our <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>."</p>
<p>All at once he broke out explosively, "<i>Pasque-Dieu</i>! What people are those who claim to be voyers, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Commission_of_Justiciary" property="schema:name">justiciaries</span>, lords and masters in our domains? who have their tollgates at the end of every field? their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gallows" property="schema:name">gallows</span> and their <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Executioner" property="schema:name">hangman</span> at every cross-road among our people? So that as the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Greek</span> believed that he had as many gods as there were fountains, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Persian</span> as many as he beheld stars, the Frenchman counts as many kings as he sees <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbets</span>! Pardieu! 'tis an evil thing, and the confusion of it displeases me. I should greatly like to know whether it be the mercy of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> that there should be in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> any other lord than the king, any other judge than our parliament, any other emperor than ourselves in this empire! By the faith of my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>! the day must certainly come when there shall exist in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span> but one king, one lord, one judge, one <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Executioner" property="schema:name">headsman</span>, as there is in paradise but one <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>!"</p>
<p>He lifted his cap again, and continued, still dreamily, with the air and accent of a hunter who is cheering on his pack of hounds: "Good, my people! bravely done! break these false lords! do your duty! at them! have at them! pillage them! take them! sack them!... Ah! you want to be kings, messeigneurs? On, my people on!"</p>
<p>Here he interrupted himself abruptly, bit his lips as though to take back his thought which had already half escaped, bent his piercing eyes in turn on each of the five persons who surrounded him, and suddenly grasping his hat with both hands and staring full at it, he said to it: "Oh! I would burn you if you knew what there was in my head."</p>
<p>Then casting about him once more the cautious and uneasy glance of the fox re-entering his hole,—</p>
<p>"No matter! we will succor monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span>. Unfortunately, we have but few troops here at the present moment, against so great a populace. We must wait until to-morrow. The order will be transmitted to the City and every one who is caught will be immediately hung."</p>
<p>"By the way, sire," said Gossip Coictier, "I had forgotten that in the first agitation, the watch have seized two laggards of the band. If your majesty desires to see these men, they are here."</p>
<p>"If I de<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span> to see them!" cried the king. "What! <i>Pasque-Dieu</i>! You forget a thing like that! Run quick, you, Olivier! Go, seek them!"</p>
<p>Master Olivier quitted the room and returned a moment later with the two prisoners, surrounded by archers of the guard. The first had a coarse, idiotic, drunken and astonished face. He was clothed in rags, and walked with one knee bent and dragging his leg. The second had a pallid and smiling countenance, with which the reader is already acquainted.</p>
<p>The king surveyed them for a moment without uttering a word, then addressing the first one abruptly,—</p>
<p>"What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Gieffroy Pincebourde."</p>
<p>"Your trade."</p>
<p>"Outcast."</p>
<p>"What were you going to do in this damnable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sedition" property="schema:name">sedition</span>?" The outcast stared at the king, and swung his arms with a stupid air.</p>
<p>He had one of those awkwardly shaped heads where intelligence is about as much at its ease as a light beneath an extinguisher.</p>
<p>"I know not," said he. "They went, I went."</p>
<p>"Were you not going to outrageously attack and pillage your lord, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> of the pa<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lace" property="schema:name">lace</span>?"</p>
<p>"I know that they were going to take something from some one. That is all."</p>
<p>A soldier pointed out to the king a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Billhook" property="schema:name">billhook</span> which he had seized on the person of the vagabond.</p>
<p>"Do you recognize this weapon?" demanded the king.</p>
<p>"Yes; 'tis my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Billhook" property="schema:name">billhook</span>; I am a vine-dresser."</p>
<p>"And do you recognize this man as your companion?" added <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>., pointing to the other prisoner.</p>
<p>"No, I do not know him."</p>
<p>"That will do," said the king, making a sign with his finger to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span> personage who stood motionless beside the door, to whom we have already called the reader's attention.</p>
<p>"Gossip Tristan, here is a man for you."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tristan" property="schema:name">Tristan</span> l'Hermite bowed. He gave an order in a low voice to two archers, who led away the poor vagabond.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the king had approached the second prisoner, who was perspiring in great drops: "Your name?"</p>
<p>"Sire, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span>."</p>
<p>"Your trade?"</p>
<p>"Philosopher, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>."</p>
<p>"How do you permit yourself, knave, to go and besiege our friend, monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace_of_Versailles" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">palace</span>, and what have you to say concerning this popular agitation?"</p>
<p>"Sire, I had nothing to do with it."</p>
<p>"Come, now! you wanton wretch, were not you apprehended by the watch in that bad company?"</p>
<p>"No, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>, there is a mistake. 'Tis a fatality. I make tragedies. Sire, I entreat your majesty to listen to me. I am a poet. 'Tis the melancholy way of men of my profession to roam the streets by night. I was passing there. It was mere chance. I was unjustly arrested; I am innocent of this civil tempest. Your majesty sees that the vagabond did not recognize me. I conjure your majesty—"</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue!" said the king, between two swallows of his ptisan. "You split our head!"</p>
<p>Tristan l'Hermite advanced and pointing to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>,—</p>
<p>"Sire, can this one be hanged also?"</p>
<p>This was the first word that he had uttered.</p>
<p>"Phew!" replied the king, "I see no objection."</p>
<p>"I see a great many!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p>At that moment, our <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span> was greener than an olive. He perceived from the king's cold and indifferent <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yao_people" property="schema:name">mien</span> that there was no other resource than something very pathetic, and he flung himself at the feet of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>., exclaiming, with gestures of despair:—</p>
<p>"Sire! will your majesty deign to hear me. Sire! break not in thunder over so small a thing as myself. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>'s great <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lightning" property="schema:name">lightning</span> doth not bombard a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lettuce" property="schema:name">lettuce</span>. Sire, you are an august and, very puissant monarch; have pity on a poor man who is honest, and who would find it more difficult to stir up a revolt than a cake of ice would to give out a spark! Very gracious <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>, kindness is the virtue of a lion and a king. Alas! rigor only frightens minds; the impetuous gusts of the north wind do not make the traveller lay aside his cloak; the sun, bestowing his rays little by little, warms him in such ways that it will make him strip to his shirt. Sire, you are the sun. I protest to you, my sovereign lord and master, that I am not an outcast, thief, and disorderly fellow. Revolt and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brigandage" property="schema:name">brigandage</span> belong not to the outfit of Apollo. I am not the man to fling myself into those clouds which break out into seditious clamor. I am your majesty's faithful vassal. That same jealousy which a husband cherisheth for the honor of his wife, the resentment which the son hath for the love of his father, a good vassal should feel for the glory of his king; he should pine away for the zeal of this house, for the aggrandizement of his service. Every other passion which should transport him would be but madness. These, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" property="schema:name">sire</span>, are my maxims of state: then do not judge me to be a seditious and thieving rascal because my garment is worn at the elbows. If you will grant me mercy, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" property="schema:name">sire</span>, I will wear it out on the knees in praying to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> for you night and morning! Alas! I am not extremely rich, 'tis true. I am even rather poor. But not vicious on that account. It is not my fault. Every one knoweth that great wealth is not to be drawn from literature, and that those who are best posted in good books do not always have a great fire in winter. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Advocate" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">The advocate</span>'s trade taketh all the grain, and leaveth only straw to the other scientific professions. There are forty very excellent <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proverb" property="schema:name">proverbs</span> anent the hole-ridden cloak of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span>. Oh, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" property="schema:name">sire</span>! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pardon" property="schema:name">clemency</span> is the only light which can enlighten the interior of so great a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>. Clemency beareth the torch before all the other virtues. Without it they are but blind men groping after <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> in the dark. Compassion, which is the same thing as <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pardon" property="schema:name">clemency</span>, causeth the love of subjects, which is the most powerful bodyguard to a prince. What matters it to your majesty, who dazzles all faces, if there is one poor man more on earth, a poor innocent <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span> spluttering amid the shadows of calamity, with an empty pocket which resounds against his hollow belly? Moreover, sire, I am a man of letters. Great kings make a pearl for their crowns by protecting letters. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heracles" property="schema:name">Hercules</span> did not disdain the title of Musagetes. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matthias_Corvinus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Mathias Corvin</span> favored Jean de Monroyal, the ornament of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mathematics" property="schema:name">mathematics</span>. Now, 'tis an ill way to protect letters to hang men of letters. What a stain on Alexander if he had hung <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Aristoteles</span>! This act would not be a little patch on the face of his reputation to embellish it, but a very <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer" property="schema:name">malignant</span> ulcer to disfigure it. Sire! I made a very proper <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epithalamium" property="schema:name">epithalamium</span> for Mademoiselle of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flanders</span> and Monseigneur the very august <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dauphin_of_France" property="schema:name">Dauphin</span>. That is not a firebrand of rebellion. Your majesty sees that I am not a scribbler of no reputation, that I have studied excellently well, and that I possess much natural eloquence. Have mercy upon me, sire! In so doing you will perform a gallant deed to our Lady, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Swear" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">I swear</span> to you that I am greatly terrified at the idea of being hanged!"</p>
<p>So saying, the unhappy <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> kissed the king's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slipper" property="schema:name">slippers</span>, and Guillaume Rym said to Coppenole in a low tone: "He doth well to drag himself on the earth. Kings are like the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crete" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Crete</span>, they have ears only in their feet." And without troubling himself about the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crete" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Crete</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span> replied with a heavy smile, and his eyes fixed on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>: "Oh! that's it exactly! I seem to hear Chancellor Hugonet craving mercy of me."</p>
<p>When <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> paused at last, quite out of breath, he raised his head tremblingly towards the king, who was engaged in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scratching" property="schema:name">scratching</span> a spot on the knee of his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breeches" property="schema:name">breeches</span> with his finger-nail; then his majesty began to drink from the goblet of ptisan. But he uttered not a word, and this silence tortured <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>. At last the king looked at him. "Here is a terrible bawler!" said, he. Then, turning to Tristan l'Hermite, "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bali" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bali</span>! let him go!"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> fell backwards, quite <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thunderstruck_(song)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">thunderstruck</span> with joy.</p>
<p>"At liberty!" growled <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tristan" property="schema:name">Tristan</span> "Doth not your majesty wish to have him detained a little while in a cage?"</p>
<p>"Gossip," retorted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>., "think you that 'tis for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">birds</span> of this feather that we cause to be made cages at three hundred and sixty-seven <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_livre" property="schema:name">livres</span>, eight sous, three deniers apiece? Release him at once, the wanton (<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. was fond of this word which formed, with <i>Pasque-Dieu</i>, the foundation of his joviality), and put him out with a buffet."</p>
<p>"Ugh!" cried <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "what a great king is here!"</p>
<p>And for fear of a counter order, he rushed towards the door, which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tristan" property="schema:name">Tristan</span> opened for him with a very bad <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_grace" property="schema:name">grace</span>. The soldiers left the room with him, pushing him before them with stout thwacks, which <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> bore like a true stoical <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span>.</p>
<p>The king's good humor since the revolt against the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> had been announced to him, made itself apparent in every w<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ay" property="schema:name">ay</span>. This unwonted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pardon" property="schema:name">clemency</span> was no small sign of it. Tristan l'Hermite in his corner wore the surly look of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">dog</span> who has had a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bone" property="schema:name">bone</span> snatched away from him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the king <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rug_hooking" property="schema:name">thrummed</span> gayly with his fingers on the arm of his chair, the March of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pont-Audemer" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Pont-Audemer</span>. He was a dissembling prince, but one who understood far better how to hide his troubles than his joys. These external manifestations of joy at any good news sometimes proceeded to very great lengths thus, on the death, of Charles the Bold, to the point of vowing silver <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrades</span> to Saint Martin of Tours; on his advent to the throne, so far as forgetting to order his father's obsequies.</p>
<p>"Hé! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>!" suddenly exclaimed Jacques Coictier, "what has become of the acute attack of illness for which your majesty had me summoned?"</p>
<p>"Oh!" said the king, "I really suffer greatly, my gossip. There is a hissing in my ear and fiery rakes rack my chest."</p>
<p>Coictier took the king's hand, and begun to feel of his pulse with a knowing air.</p>
<p>"Look, Coppenole," said Rym, in a low voice. "Behold him between Coictier and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tristan" property="schema:name">Tristan</span>. They are his whole court. A <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span> for himself, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Executioner" property="schema:name">headsman</span> for others."</p>
<p>As he felt the king's pulse, Coictier assumed an air of greater and greater alarm. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. watched him with some <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anxiety" property="schema:name">anxiety</span>. Coictier grew visibly more gloomy. The brave man had no other farm than the king's bad health. He speculated on it to the best of his ability.</p>
<p>"Oh! oh!" he <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathy_voice" property="schema:name">murmured</span> at length, "this is serious indeed."</p>
<p>"Is it not?" said the king, uneasily.</p>
<p>"<i>Pulsus creber, anhelans, crepitans, irregularis</i>," continued the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leech" property="schema:name">leech</span>.</p>
<p>"<i>Pasque-Dieu</i>!"</p>
<p>"This may carry off its man in less than three days."</p>
<p>"Our Lady!" exclaimed the king. "And the remedy, gossip?"</p>
<p>"I am meditating upon that, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>."</p>
<p>He made <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. put out his tongue, shook his head, made a grimace, and in the very midst of these affectations,—</p>
<p>"Pardieu, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>," he suddenly said, "I must tell you that there is a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bankruptcy" property="schema:name">receivership</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_prerogative" property="schema:name">royal prerogatives</span> vacant, and that I have a nephew."</p>
<p>"I give the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bankruptcy" property="schema:name">receivership</span> to your nephew, Gossip Jacques," replied the king; "but draw this fire from my breast."</p>
<p>"Since your majesty is so <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clement_of_Alexandria" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">clement</span>," replied the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leech" property="schema:name">leech</span>, "you will not refuse to aid me a little in building my house, Rue Saint-André-des-Arcs."</p>
<p>"Heugh!" said the king.</p>
<p>"I am at the end of my finances," pursued the doctor; "and it would really be a pity that the house should not have a roof; not on account of the house, which is simple and thoroughly <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span>, but because of the paintings of Jehan Fourbault, which adorn its wainscoating. There is a Diana flying in the air, but so excellent, so tender, so delicate, of so ingenuous an action, her hair so well coiffed and adorned with a crescent, her flesh so white, that she leads into temptation those who regard her too curiously. There is also a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ceres_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Ceres</span>. She is another very fair divinity. She is seated on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pulley" property="schema:name">sheaves</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wheat" property="schema:name">wheat</span> and crowned with a gallant garland of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wheat" property="schema:name">wheat</span> ears <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interlace_(art)" property="schema:name">interlaced</span> with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tragopogon_porrifolius" property="schema:name">salsify</span> and other <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flower" property="schema:name">flowers</span>. Never were seen more amorous eyes, more rounded limbs, a nobler air, or a more gracefully flowing skirt. She is one of the most innocent and most perfect beauties whom the brush has ever produced."</p>
<p>"Executioner!" grumbled <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>., "what are you driving at?"</p>
<p>"I must have a roof for these paintings, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>, and, although 'tis but a small matter, I have no more money."</p>
<p>"How much doth your roof cost?"</p>
<p>"Why a roof of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copper" property="schema:name">copper</span>, embellished and gilt, two thousand <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_livre" property="schema:name">livres</span> at the most."</p>
<p>"Ah, assassin!" cried the king, "He never draws out one of my teeth which is not a diamond."</p>
<p>"Am I to have my roof?" said Coictier.</p>
<p>"Yes; and go to the devil, but cure me."</p>
<p>Jacques Coictier bowed low and said,—</p>
<p>"Sire, it is a repellent which will save you. We will apply to your loins the great defensive composed of cerate, Armenian bole, white of egg, oil, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vinegar" property="schema:name">vinegar</span>. You will continue your ptisan and we will answer for your majesty."</p>
<p>A burning candle does not attract one <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gnat" property="schema:name">gnat</span> alone. Master Olivier, perceiving the king to be in a liberal mood, and judging the moment to be propitious, approached in his turn.</p>
<p>"Sire—"</p>
<p>"What is it now?" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. "Sire, your majesty knoweth that Simon Radin is dead?"</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"He was councillor to the king in the matter of the courts of the treasury."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Sire, his place is vacant."</p>
<p>As he spoke thus, Master Olivier's haughty face quitted its arrogant expression for a lowly one. It is the only change which ever takes place in a courtier's visage. The king looked him well in the face and said in a dry tone,—"I understand."</p>
<p>He resumed,</p>
<p>"Master Olivier, the Marshal de Boucicaut was wont to say, 'There's no master save the king, there are no fishes save in the sea.' I see that you agree with Monsieur de Boucicaut. Now listen to this; we have a good <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Memory" property="schema:name">memory</span>. In '68 we made you <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Valet" property="schema:name">valet</span> of our chamber: in '69, guardian of the fortress of the bridge of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Château_de_Saint-Cloud" property="schema:name">Saint-Cloud</span>, at a hundred <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livre_tournois" property="schema:name">livres</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tournai" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Tournay</span> in wages (you wanted them of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>). In November, '73, by letters given to Gergeole, we instituted you keeper of the Wood of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vincennes" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Vincennes</span>, in the place of Gilbert <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acle" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Acle</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Equerry" property="schema:name">equerry</span>; in '75, gruyer* of the forest of Rouvray-lez-Saint-Cloud, in the place of Jacques <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacob_Le_Maire" property="schema:name">le Maire</span>; in '78, we graciously settled on you, by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Letters_patent" property="schema:name">letters patent</span> sealed doubly with green <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wax" property="schema:name">wax</span>, an income of ten livres parisis, for you and your wife, on the Place of the Merchants, situated at the School Saint-Germain; in '79, we made you gruyer of the forest of Senart, in place of that poor Jehan Daiz; then captain of the Château of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loches" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Loches</span>; then governor of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Quentin,_Aisne" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Quentin</span>; then captain of the bridge of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Meulan-en-Yvelines" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Meulan</span>, of which you cause yourself to be called comte. Out of the five <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span> fine paid by every barber who shaves on a festival day, there are three <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span> for you and we have the rest. We have been good enough to change your name of Le Mauvais (The Evil), which resembled your face too closely. In '76, we granted you, to the great displeasure of our nobility, armorial bearings of a thousand colors, which give you the breast of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peafowl" property="schema:name">peacock</span>. <i>Pasque-Dieu</i>! Are not you surfeited? Is not the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ox" property="schema:name">draught</span> of fishes sufficiently fine and miraculous? Are you not afraid that one <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salmon" property="schema:name">salmon</span> more will make your boat sink? Pride will be your ruin, gossip. Ruin and disgrace always press hard on the heels of pride. Consider this and hold your tongue."</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  A lord having a right on the woods of his vassals.<br/></div>
<p>These words, uttered with severity, made Master Olivier's face revert to its insolence.</p>
<p>"Good!" he muttered, almost aloud, "'tis easy to see that the king is ill to-day; he giveth all to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leech" property="schema:name">leech</span>."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. far from being irritated by this petulant insult, resumed with some gentleness, "Stay, I was forgetting that I made you my ambassador to Madame Marie, at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghent" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Ghent</span>. Yes, gentlemen," added the king turning to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemings</span>, "this man hath been an ambassador. There, my gossip," he pursued, addressing Master Olivier, "let us not get angry; we are old friends. 'Tis very late. We have terminated our labors. Shave me."</p>
<p>Our readers have not, without doubt, waited until the present moment to recognize in Master Olivier that terrible Figaro whom <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_providence" property="schema:name">Providence</span>, the great maker of dramas, mingled so artistically in the long and bloody comedy of the reign of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. We will not here undertake to develop that singular figure. This barber of the king had three names. At court he was politely called Olivier le Daim (the Deer); among the people Olivier the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Devil" property="schema:name">Devil</span>. His real name was Olivier le Mauvais.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Olivier le Mauvais remained motionless, sulking at the king, and glancing askance at Jacques Coictier.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span>!" he said between his teeth.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span>!" retorted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>., with singular good humor; "the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" property="schema:name">physician</span> has more credit than you. 'Tis very simple; he has taken hold upon us by the whole body, and you hold us only by the chin. Come, my poor barber, all will come right. What would you say and what would become of your office if I were a king like <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chilperic_I" property="schema:name">Chilperic</span>, whose gesture consisted in holding his beard in one hand? Come, gossip mine, fulfil your office, shave me. Go get what you need therefor."</p>
<p>Olivier perceiving that the king had made up his mind to laugh, and that there was no way of even annoying him, went off grumbling to execute his orders.</p>
<p>The king rose, approached the window, and suddenly opening it with extraordinary agitation,—</p>
<p>"Oh! yes!" he exclaimed, clapping his hands, "yonder is a redness in the sky over the City. 'Tis the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> burning. It can be nothing else but that. Ah! my good people! here you are aiding me at last in tearing down the rights of lordship!"</p>
<p>Then turning towards the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemings</span>: "Come, look at this, gentlemen. Is it not a fire which gloweth yonder?"</p>
<p>The two men of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghent" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Ghent</span> drew near.</p>
<p>"A great fire," said Guillaume Rym.</p>
<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Coppenole, whose eyes suddenly flashed, "that reminds me of the burning of the house of the Seigneur d'Hymbercourt. There must be a goodly revolt yonder."</p>
<p>"You think so, Master Coppenole?" And <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>.'s glance was almost as joyous as that of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span>. "Will it not be difficult to resist?"</p>
<p>"Cross of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>! Sire! Your majesty will damage many companies of men of war thereon."</p>
<p>"Ah! I! 'tis different," returned the king. "If I willed." The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span> replied hardily,—</p>
<p>"If this revolt be what I suppose, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>, you might will in vain."</p>
<p>"Gossip," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>., "with the two companies of my unattached troops and one discharge of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gunpowder" property="schema:name">serpentine</span>, short work is made of a populace of louts."</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span>, in spite of the signs made to him by Guillaume Rym, appeared determined to hold his own against the king.</p>
<p>"Sire, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Swiss_Confederacy" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Swiss</span> were also louts. Monsieur the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Burgundy" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Burgundy</span> was a great gentleman, and he turned up his nose at that rabble rout. At the battle of Grandson, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>, he cried: 'Men of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cannon" property="schema:name">cannon</span>! Fire on the villains!' and he swore by Saint-George. But Advoyer Scharnachtal hurled himself on the handsome duke with his battle-club and his people, and when the glittering <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Burgundy" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Burgundian</span> army came in contact with these peasants in bull hides, it flew in pieces like a pane of glass at the blow of a pebble. Many lords were then slain by low-born knaves; and Monsieur de Château-Guyon, the greatest <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord" property="schema:name">seigneur</span> in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Burgundy" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Burgundy</span>, was found dead, with his gray horse, in a little marsh meadow."</p>
<p>"Friend," returned the king, "you are speaking of a battle. The question here is of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mutiny" property="schema:name">mutiny</span>. And I will gain the upper hand of it as soon as it shall please me to frown."</p>
<p>The other replied indifferently,—</p>
<p>"That may be, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>; in that case, 'tis because the people's hour hath not yet come."</p>
<p>Guillaume Rym considered it incumbent on him to intervene,—</p>
<p>"Master Coppenole, you are speaking to a puissant king."</p>
<p>"I know it," replied the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span>, gravely.</p>
<p>"Let him speak, Monsieur Rym, my friend," said the king; "I love this frankness of speech. My father, Charles the Seventh, was accustomed to say that the truth was ailing; I thought her dead, and that she had found no confessor. Master Coppenole undeceiveth me."</p>
<p>Then, laying his hand familiarly on Coppenole's shoulder,—</p>
<p>"You were saying, Master Jacques?"</p>
<p>"I say, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>, that you may possibly be in the right, that the hour of the people may not yet have come with you."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. gazed at him with his penetrating eye,—</p>
<p>"And when will that hour come, master?"</p>
<p>"You will hear it strike."</p>
<p>"On what clock, if you please?"</p>
<p>Coppenole, with his tranquil and rustic countenance, made the king approach the window.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Listen_(Beyoncé_Knowles_song)" property="schema:name">Listen</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>! There is here a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keep" property="schema:name">donjon</span> keep, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">belfry</span>, cannons, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span>, soldiers; when the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bell_tower" property="schema:name">belfry</span> shall hum, when the cannons shall roar, when the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keep" property="schema:name">donjon</span> shall fall in ruins amid great noise, when <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> and soldiers shall howl and slay each other, the hour will strike."</p>
<p>Louis's face grew sombre and dreamy. He remained <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silent_film" property="schema:name">silent</span> for a moment, then he gently patted with his hand the thick wall of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keep" property="schema:name">donjon</span>, as one strokes the haunches of a steed.</p>
<p>"Oh! no!" said he. "You will not crumble so easily, will you, my good <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution" property="schema:name">Bastille</span>?"</p>
<p>And turning with an abrupt gesture towards the sturdy Fleming,—</p>
<p>"Have you never seen a revolt, Master Jacques?"</p>
<p>"I have made them," said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span>.</p>
<p>"How do you set to work to make a revolt?" said the king.</p>
<p>"Ah!" replied Coppenole, "'tis not very difficult. There are a hundred ways. In the first place, there must be discontent in the city. The thing is not uncommon. And then, the character of the inhabitants. Those of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghent" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Ghent</span> are easy to stir into revolt. They always love the prince's son; the prince, never. Well! One morning, I will suppose, some one enters my shop, and says to me: 'Father Coppenole, there is this and there is that, the Demoiselle of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/County_of_Flanders" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Flanders</span> wishes to save her ministers, the grand <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> is doubling the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tax" property="schema:name">impost</span> on <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shagreen" property="schema:name">shagreen</span>, or something else,'—what you will. I leave my work as it stands, I come out of my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span>'s stall, and I shout: 'To the sack?' There is always some smashed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barrel" property="schema:name">cask</span> at hand. I mount it, and I say aloud, in the first words that occur to me, what I have on my heart; and when one is of the people, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>, one always has something on the heart: Then people troop up, they shout, they ring the alarm bell, they arm the louts with what they take from the soldiers, the market people join in, and they set out. And it will always be thus, so long as there are lords in the seignories, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> in the bourgs, and peasants in the country."</p>
<p>"And against whom do you thus rebel?" inquired the king; "against your <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiffs</span>? against your lords?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes; that depends. Against the duke, also, sometimes."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. returned and seated himself, saying, with a smile,—</p>
<p>"Ah! here they have only got as far as the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiffs</span>."</p>
<p>At that instant Olivier le Daim returned. He was followed by two pages, who bore the king's toilet articles; but what struck <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. was that he was also accompanied by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> and the chevalier of the watch, who appeared to be in consternation. The spiteful barber also wore an air of consternation, which was one of contentment beneath, however. It was he who spoke first.</p>
<p>"Sire, I ask your majesty's pardon for the calamitous news which I bring."</p>
<p>The king turned quickly and grazed the mat on the floor with the feet of his chair,—</p>
<p>"What does this mean?"</p>
<p>"Sire," resumed Olivier le Daim, with the malicious air of a man who rejoices that he is about to deal a violent blow, "'tis not against the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span> of the courts that this popular <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sedition" property="schema:name">sedition</span> is directed."</p>
<p>"Against whom, then?"</p>
<p>"Against you, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" property="schema:name">sire</span>?'</p>
<p>The aged king rose erect and straight as a young man,—</p>
<p>"Explain yourself, Olivier! And guard your head well, gossip; for I swear to you by the cross of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Lô" property="schema:name">Saint-Lô</span> that, if you lie to us at this hour, the sword which severed the head of Monsieur de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luxembourg" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Luxembourg</span> is not so notched that it cannot yet sever yours!"</p>
<p>The oath was formidable; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. had only sworn twice in the course of his life by the cross of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Lô" property="schema:name">Saint-Lô</span>.</p>
<p>Olivier opened his mouth to reply.</p>
<p>"Sire—"</p>
<p>"On your knees!" interrupted the king violently. "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tristan" property="schema:name">Tristan</span>, have an eye to this man."</p>
<p>Olivier knelt down and said coldly,—</p>
<p>"Sire, a sorceress was condemned to death by your court of parliament. She took refuge in Notre-Dame. The people are trying to take her from thence by main <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span>. Monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(religion)" property="schema:name">provost</span> and monsieur the chevalier of the watch, who have just come from the riot, are here to give me the lie if this is not the truth. The populace is besieging Notre-Dame."</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed!" said the king in a low voice, all pale and trembling with wrath. "Notre-Dame! They lay siege to our Lady, my good mistress in her cathedral!—Rise, Olivier. You are right. I give you Simon Radin's charge. You are right. 'Tis I whom they are attacking. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witch</span> is under the protection of this church, the church is under my protection. And I thought that they were acting against the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailiff" property="schema:name">bailiff</span>! 'Tis against myself!"</p>
<p>Then, rendered young by fury, he began to walk up and down with long strides. He no longer laughed, he was terrible, he went and came; the fox was changed into a hyaena. He seemed suffocated to such a degree that he could not speak; his lips moved, and his fleshless fists were clenched. All at once he raised his head, his hollow eye appeared full of light, and his voice burst forth like a clarion: "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/County_Down" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Down</span> with them, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tristan" property="schema:name">Tristan</span>! A heavy hand for these rascals! Go, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tristan" property="schema:name">Tristan</span>, my friend! slay! slay!"</p>
<p>This eruption having passed, he returned to his seat, and said with cold and concentrated wrath,—</p>
<p>"Here, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tristan" property="schema:name">Tristan</span>! There are here with us in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bastille" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Bastille</span> the fifty lances of the Vicomte de Gif, which makes three hundred horse: you will take them. There is also the company of our unattached archers of Monsieur de Châteaupers: you will take it. You are provost of the marshals; you have the men of your <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span>ship: you will take them. At the Hôtel Saint-Pol you will find forty archers of monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dauphin_of_France" property="schema:name">dauphin</span>'s new guard: you will take them. And, with all these, you will hasten to Notre-Dame. Ah! messieurs, louts of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, do you fling yourselves thus against the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_(headgear)" property="schema:name">crown</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>, the sanctity of Notre-Dame, and the peace of this commonwealth! Exterminate, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tristan" property="schema:name">Tristan</span>! exterminate! and let not a single one escape, except it be for Montfauçon."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tristan" property="schema:name">Tristan</span> bowed. "'Tis well, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>."</p>
<p>He added, after a silence, "And what shall I do with the sorceress?"</p>
<p>This question caused the king to meditate.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said he, "the sorceress! Monsieur d'Estouteville, what did the people wish to do with her?"</p>
<p>"Sire," replied the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, "I imagine that since the populace has come to tear her from her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Refugee" property="schema:name">asylum</span> in Notre-Dame, 'tis because that impunity wounds them, and they desire to hang her."</p>
<p>The king appeared to reflect deeply: then, addressing Tristan l'Hermite, "Well! gossip, exterminate the people and hang the sorceress."</p>
<p>"That's it," said Rym in a low tone to Coppenole, "punish the people for willing a thing, and then do what they wish."</p>
<p>"Enough, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horse" property="schema:name">sire</span>," replied Tristan. "If the sorceress is still in Notre-Dame, must she be seized in spite of the sanctuary?"</p>
<p>"<i>Pasque-Dieu</i>! the sanctuary!" said the king, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scratching" property="schema:name">scratching</span> his ear. "But the woman must be hung, nevertheless."</p>
<p>Here, as though seized with a sudden idea, he flung himself on his knees before his chair, took off his hat, placed it on the seat, and gazing devoutly at one of the leaden <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amulet" property="schema:name">amulets</span> which loaded it down, "Oh!" said he, with clasped hands, "our Lady of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, my gracious patroness, pardon me. I will only do it this once. This criminal must be punished. I assure you, madame the virgin, my good mistress, that she is a sorceress who is not worthy of your amiable protection. You know, madame, that many very pious princes have overstepped the privileges of the churches for the glory of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> and the necessities of the State. Saint Hugues, bishop of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">England</span>, permitted King Edward to hang a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witch</span> in his church. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_IX_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Saint-Louis</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>, my master, transgressed, with the same object, the church of Monsieur Saint-Paul; and Monsieur Alphonse, son of the king of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerusalem" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Jerusalem</span>, the very church of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Holy Sepulchre</span>. Pardon me, then, for this once. Our Lady of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, I will never do so again, and I will give you a fine statue of silver, like the one which I gave last year to Our Lady of Ecouys. So be it."</p>
<p>He made the sign of the cross, rose, donned his hat once more, and said to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tristan" property="schema:name">Tristan</span>,—</p>
<p>"Be diligent, gossip. Take Monsieur Châteaupers with you. You will cause the tocsin to be sounded. You will crush the populace. You <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wil" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">wil</span>l seize the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witch</span>. 'Tis said. And I mean the business of the execution to be done by you. You will render me an account of it. Come, Olivier, I shall not go to bed this night. Shave me."</p>
<p>Tristan l'Hermite bowed and departed. Then the king, dismissing Rym and Coppenole with a gesture,—</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> guard you, messieurs, my good friends the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemings</span>. Go, take a little repose. The night advances, and we are nearer the morning than the evening."</p>
<p>Both retired and gained their apartments under the guidance of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_(armed_forces)" property="schema:name">captain</span> of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution" property="schema:name">Bastille</span>. Coppenole said to Guillaume Rym,—</p>
<p>"Hum! I have had enough of that coughing king! I have seen Charles of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burgundy" typeof="schema:AdministrativeArea" property="schema:name">Burgundy</span> drunk, and he was less <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer" property="schema:name">malignant</span> than <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. when ailing."</p>
<p>"Master Jacques," replied Rym, "'tis because <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span> renders kings less cruel than does barley water."</p>

On arriving at the Baudoyer gate, he walked straight to the stone cross which rose in the middle of that place, as though he were able to distinguish in the darkness the figure of a man clad and cloaked in black, who was seated on the steps of the cross.</p>
<p>"Is it you, master?" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p>The personage in black rose.</p>
<p>"Death and passion! You make me boil, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>. The man on the tower of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/St-Gervais-et-St-Protais" property="schema:name">Saint-Gervais</span> has just cried half-past one o'clock in the morning."</p>
<p>"Oh," retorted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "'tis no fault of mine, but of the watch and the king. I have just had a narrow escape. I always just miss being hung. 'Tis my <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Predestination" property="schema:name">predestination</span>."</p>
<p>"You lack everything," said the other. "But come quickly. Have you the password?"</p>
<p>"Fancy, master, I have seen the king. I come from him. He wears <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fustian" property="schema:name">fustian</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breeches" property="schema:name">breeches</span>. 'Tis an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adventure" property="schema:name">adventure</span>."</p>
<p>"Oh! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Distaff" property="schema:name">distaff</span> of words! what is your <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adventure" property="schema:name">adventure</span> to me! Have you the password of the outcasts?"</p>
<p>"I have it. Be at ease. 'Little sword in pocket.'"</p>
<p>"Good. Otherwise, we could not make our way as far as the church. The outcasts bar the streets. Fortunately, it appears that they have encountered resistance. We may still arrive in time."</p>
<p>"Yes, master, but how are we to get into Notre-Dame?"</p>
<p>"I have the key to the tower."</p>
<p>"And how are we to get out again?"</p>
<p>"Behind the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloister" property="schema:name">cloister</span> there is a little door which opens on the Terrain and the water. I have taken the key to it, and I moored a boat there this morning."</p>
<p>"I have had a beautiful escape from being hung!" <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> repeated.</p>
<p>"Eh, quick! come!" said the other.</p>
<p>Both descended towards the city with long strides.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00071">CHAPTER VII. CHATEAUPERS TO THE RESCUE.</h2>
<p>The reader will, perhaps, recall the critical situation in which we left <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>. The brave <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man, assailed on all sides, had lost, if not all courage, at least all hope of saving, not himself (he was not thinking of himself), but the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>. He ran distractedly along the gallery. Notre-Dame was on the point of being taken by storm by the outcasts. All at once, a great galloping of horses filled the neighboring streets, and, with a long file of torches and a thick column of cavaliers, with free reins and lances in rest, these furious sounds <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Debouch" property="schema:name">debouched</span> on the Place like a hurricane,—</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>! cut down the louts! Châteaupers to the rescue! Provostship! Provostship!"</p>
<p>The frightened <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span> wheeled round.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> who did not hear, saw the naked swords, the torches, the irons of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pike_(weapon)" property="schema:name">pikes</span>, all that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry" property="schema:name">cavalry</span>, at the head of which he recognized <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Captain_Phoebus" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Captain Phoebus</span>; he beheld the confusion of the outcasts, the terror of some, the disturbance among the bravest of them, and from this unexpected succor he recovered so much strength, that he hurled from the church the first assailants who were already climbing into the gallery.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, the king's troops who had arrived. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span> behaved bravely. They defended themselves like desperate men. Caught on the flank, by the Rue Saint-Pierre-aux-Boeufs, and in the rear through the Rue du Parvis, driven to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bay_(horse)" property="schema:name">bay</span> against Notre-Dame, which they still assailed and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> defended, at the same time besiegers and besieged, they were in the singular situation in which Comte Henri Harcourt, <i>Taurinum obsessor idem et obsessus</i>, as his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epitaph" property="schema:name">epitaph</span> says, found himself later on, at the famous siege of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turin" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Turin</span>, in 1640, between Prince Thomas of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savoy" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Savoy</span>, whom he was besieging, and the Marquis de Leganez, who was blockading him.</p>
<p>The battle was frightful. There was a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog" property="schema:name">dog</span>'s tooth for wolf's flesh, as P. Mathieu says. The king's cavaliers, in whose midst <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo" property="schema:name">Phoebus</span> de Châteaupers bore himself valiantly, gave no quarter, and the slash of the sword disposed of those who escaped the thrust of the lance. The outcasts, badly armed foamed and bit with rage. Men, women, children, hurled themselves on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crupper" property="schema:name">cruppers</span> and the breasts of the horses, and hung there like cats, with teeth, finger nails and toe nails. Others struck the archers' in the face with their torches. Others thrust <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron" property="schema:name">iron</span> hooks into the necks of the cavaliers and dragged them down. They slashed in pieces those who fell.</p>
<p>One was noticed who had a large, glittering <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythe" property="schema:name">scythe</span>, and who, for a long time, mowed the legs of the horses. He was frightful. He was singing a ditty, with a nasal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_tuning" property="schema:name">intonation</span>, he swung and drew back his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythe" property="schema:name">scythe</span> incessantly. At every blow he traced around him a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_circle" property="schema:name">great circle</span> of severed limbs. He advanced thus into the very thickest of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cavalry" property="schema:name">cavalry</span>, with the tranquil slowness, the lolling of the head and the regular breathing of a harvester attacking a field of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wheat" property="schema:name">wheat</span>. It was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frédéric_Chopin" property="schema:name">Chopin</span> Trouillefou. A shot from an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arquebus" property="schema:name">arquebus</span> laid him low.</p>
<p>In the meantime, windows had been opened again. The neighbors hearing the war cries of the king's troops, had mingled in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Affray" property="schema:name">affray</span>, and bullets rained upon the outcasts from every story. The Parvis was filled with a thick smoke, which the musketry streaked with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire" property="schema:name">flame</span>. Through it one could confusedly distinguish the front of Notre-Dame, and the decrepit <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hôtel-Dieu_de_Paris" property="schema:name">Hôtel-Dieu</span> with some <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wide_area_network" property="schema:name">wan</span> invalids gazing down from the heights of its roof all checkered with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dormer" property="schema:name">dormer windows</span>.</p>
<p>At length the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span> gave way. Weariness, the lack of good weapons, the fright of this surprise, the musketry from the windows, the valiant attack of the king's troops, all overwhelmed them. They forced the line of assailants, and fled in every direction, leaving the Parvis encumbered with dead.</p>
<p>When <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, who had not ceased to fight for a moment, beheld this rout, he fell on his knees and raised his hands to heaven; then, intoxicated with joy, he ran, he ascended with the swiftness of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">bird</span> to that cell, the approaches to which he had so intrepidly defended. He had but one thought now; it was to kneel before her whom he had just saved for the second time.</p>
<p>When he entered the cell, he found it empty.</p>
