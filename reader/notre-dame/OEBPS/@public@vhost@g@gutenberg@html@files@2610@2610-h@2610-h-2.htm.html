<h2 id="pgepubid00011">CHAPTER <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/V." typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">V.</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">QUASIMODO</span>.</h2>
<p>In the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute Coppenole's idea. Bourgeois, scholars and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law_clerk" property="schema:name">law clerks</span> all set to work. The little chapel situated opposite the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> table was selected for the scene of the grinning match. A pane broken in the pretty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rose_window" property="schema:name">rose window</span> above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads. In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hogshead" property="schema:name">hogsheads</span>, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion. It was settled that each candidate, man or woman (for it was possible to choose a female pope), should, for the sake of leaving the impression of his grimace fresh and complete, cover his face and remain concealed in the chapel until the moment of his appearance. In less than an instant, the chapel was crowded with competitors, upon whom the door was then closed.</p>
<p>Coppenole, from his post, ordered all, directed all, arranged all. During the uproar, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>, no less abashed than <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, had retired with all his suite, under the pretext of business and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vespers" property="schema:name">vespers</span>, without the crowd which his arrival had so deeply stirred being in the least moved by his departure. Guillaume Rym was the only one who noticed his eminence's discomfiture. The attention of the populace, like the sun, pursued its revolution; having set out from one end of the hall, and halted for a space in the middle, it had now reached the other end. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> table, the brocaded gallery had each had their day; it was now the turn of the chapel of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XI_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Louis XI</span>. Henceforth, the field was open to all <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folly" property="schema:name">folly</span>. There was no one there now, but the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemings</span> and the rabble.</p>
<p>The grimaces began. The first face which appeared at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aperture" property="schema:name">aperture</span>, with eyelids turned up to the reds, a mouth open like a maw, and a brow wrinkled like our <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hussar" property="schema:name">hussar</span> boots of the Empire, evoked such an inextinguishable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ring_of_bells" property="schema:name">peal</span> of laughter that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Homer</span> would have taken all these louts for gods. Nevertheless, the grand hall was anything but <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mount_Olympus" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Olympus</span>, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>'s poor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span> knew it better than any one else. A second and third grimace followed, then another and another; and the laughter and transports of delight went on increasing. There was in this spectacle, a peculiar power of intoxication and fascination, of which it would be difficult to convey to the reader of our day and our salons any idea.</p>
<p>Let the reader picture to himself a series of visages presenting successively all geometrical forms, from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triangle" property="schema:name">triangle</span> to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trapezoid" property="schema:name">trapezium</span>, from the cone to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polyhedron" property="schema:name">polyhedron</span>; all human expressions, from wrath to lewdness; all ages, from the wrinkles of the new-born babe to the wrinkles of the aged and dying; all religious phantasmagories, from Faun to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beelzebub" property="schema:name">Beelzebub</span>; all animal profiles, from the maw to the beak, from the jowl to the muzzle. Let the reader imagine all these grotesque figures of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pont_Neuf" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Pont Neuf</span>, those nightmares <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petrifaction" property="schema:name">petrified</span> beneath the hand of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germain_Pilon" property="schema:name">Germain Pilon</span>, assuming life and breath, and coming in turn to stare you in the face with burning eyes; all the masks of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carnival" property="schema:name">Carnival</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venice" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Venice</span> passing in succession before your glass,—in a word, a human <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kaleidoscope" property="schema:name">kaleidoscope</span>.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orgy" property="schema:name">orgy</span> grew more and more <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemish</span>. Teniers could have given but a very imperfect idea of it. Let the reader picture to himself in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bacchanalia" property="schema:name">bacchanal</span> form, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salvator_Rosa" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Salvator Rosa</span>'s battle. There were no longer either scholars or ambassadors or <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> or men or women; there was no longer any <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span>, nor Gilles Lecornu, nor Marie Quatrelivres, nor <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Hood" property="schema:name">Robin</span> Poussepain. All was universal license. The grand hall was no longer anything but a vast <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span> of effrontry and joviality, where every mouth was a cry, every individual a posture; everything shouted and howled. The strange visages which came, in turn, to gnash their teeth in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rose_window" property="schema:name">rose window</span>, were like so many brands cast into the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brass" property="schema:name">brazier</span>; and from the whole of this effervescing crowd, there escaped, as from a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furnace" property="schema:name">furnace</span>, a sharp, piercing, stinging noise, hissing like the wings of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gnat" property="schema:name">gnat</span>.</p>
<p>"Ho hé! curse it!"</p>
<p>"Just look at that face!"</p>
<p>"It's not good for anything."</p>
<p>"Guillemette Maugerepuis, just look at that bull's muzzle; it only lacks the horns. It can't be your husband."</p>
<p>"Another!"</p>
<p>"Belly of the pope! what sort of a grimace is that?"</p>
<p>"Hola hé! that's cheating. One must show only one's face."</p>
<p>"That damned Perrette Callebotte! she's capable of that!"</p>
<p>"Good! Good!"</p>
<p>"I'm stifling!"</p>
<p>"There's a fellow whose ears won't go through!" Etc., etc.</p>
<p>But we must do justice to our friend Jehan. In the midst of this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">witches</span>' sabbath, he was still to be seen on the top of his pillar, like the cabin-boy on the topmast. He floundered about with incredible fury. His mouth was wide open, and from it there escaped a cry which no one heard, not that it was covered by the general clamor, great as that was but because it attained, no doubt, the limit of perceptible sharp sounds, the thousand vibrations of Sauveur, or the eight thousand of Biot.</p>
<p>As for Gringoire, the first moment of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Depression_(mood)" property="schema:name">depression</span> having passed, he had regained his composure. He had hardened himself against <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stress_(biology)" property="schema:name">adversity</span>.—-"Continue!" he had said for the third time, to his comedians, speaking machines; then as he was marching with great strides in front of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> table, a fancy seized him to go and appear in his turn at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aperture" property="schema:name">aperture</span> of the chapel, were it only for the pleasure of making a grimace at that ungrateful populace.—"But no, that would not be worthy of us; no, vengeance! let us combat until the end," he repeated to himself; "the power of poetry over people is great; I will bring them back. We shall see which will carry the day, grimaces or polite literature."</p>
<p>Alas! he had been left the sole spectator of his piece. It was far worse than it had been a little while before. He no longer beheld anything but backs.</p>
<p>I am mistaken. The big, patient man, whom he had already consulted in a critical moment, had remained with his face turned towards the stage. As for Gisquette and Liénarde, they had deserted him long ago.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> was touched to the heart by the fidelity of his only spectator. He approached him and addressed him, shaking his arm slightly; for the good man was leaning on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluster" property="schema:name">balustrade</span> and dozing a little.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "I thank you!"</p>
<p>"Monsieur," replied the big man with a yawn, "for what?"</p>
<p>"I see what wearies you," resumed the poet; "'tis all this noise which prevents your hearing comfortably. But be at ease! your name shall descend to posterity! Your name, if you please?"</p>
<p>"Renauld Chateau, guardian of the seals of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Châtelet</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, at your service."</p>
<p>"Monsieur, you are the only representative of the muses here," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>.</p>
<p>"You are too kind, sir," said the guardian of the seals at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Châtelet</span>.</p>
<p>"You are the only one," resumed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "who has listened to the piece decorously. What do you think of it?"</p>
<p>"He! he!" replied the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adipose_tissue" property="schema:name">fat</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magistrate" property="schema:name">magistrate</span>, half aroused, "it's tolerably jolly, that's a fact."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> was forced to content himself with this eulogy; for a thunder of applause, mingled with a prodigious <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acclamation" property="schema:name">acclamation</span>, cut their conversation short. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span> of the Fools had been elected.</p>
<p>"Noel! Noel! Noel!"* shouted the people on all sides. That was, in fact, a marvellous grimace which was beaming at that moment through the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aperture" property="schema:name">aperture</span> in the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rose_window" property="schema:name">rose window</span>. After all the pentagonal, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hexagon" property="schema:name">hexagonal</span>, and whimsical faces, which had succeeded each other at that hole without realizing the ideal of the grotesque which their imaginations, excited by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orgy" property="schema:name">orgy</span>, had constructed, nothing less was needed to win their suffrages than the sublime grimace which had just dazzled the assembly. Master Coppenole himself applauded, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopin_Trouillefou" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Clopin Trouillefou</span>, who had been among the competitors (and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span> knows what intensity of ugliness his visage could attain), confessed himself conquered: We will do the same. We shall not try to give the reader an idea of that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyramid" property="schema:name">tetrahedral</span> nose, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horseshoe" property="schema:name">horseshoe</span> mouth; that little left eye obstructed with a red, bushy, bristling eyebrow, while the right eye disappea<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> entirely beneath an enormous wart; of those teeth in disarray, broken here and there, like the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battlement" property="schema:name">embattled</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parapet" property="schema:name">parapet</span> of a fortress; of that callous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lip" property="schema:name">lip</span>, upon which one of these teeth encroached, like the tusk of an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elephant" property="schema:name">elephant</span>; of that forked chin; and above all, of the expression spread over the whole; of that mixture of malice, amazement, and sadness. Let the reader dream of this whole, if he can.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  The ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">French</span> hurrah.<br/></div>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acclamation" property="schema:name">acclamation</span> was unanimous; people rushed towards the chapel. They made the lucky <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span> of the Fools come forth in triumph. But it was then that surprise and admiration attained their highest pitch; the grimace was his face.</p>
<p>Or rather, his whole person was a grimace. A huge head, bristling with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span> hair; between his shoulders an enormous hump, a counterpart perceptible in front; a system of thighs and legs so strangely astray that they could touch each other only at the knees, and, viewed from the front, resembled the crescents of two <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scythe" property="schema:name">scythes</span> joined by the handles; large feet, monstrous hands; and, with all this deformity, an indescribable and redoubtable air of vigor, agility, and courage,—strange exception to the eternal rule which wills that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Force" property="schema:name">force</span> as well as beauty shall be the result of harmony. Such was the pope whom the fools had just chosen for themselves.</p>
<p>One would have pronounced him a giant who had been broken and badly put together again.</p>
<p>When this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Species" property="schema:name">species</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyclops" property="schema:name">cyclops</span> appeared on the threshold of the chapel, motionless, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Squat_(exercise)" property="schema:name">squat</span>, and almost as broad as he was tall; squared on the base, as a great man says; with his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doublet_(clothing)" property="schema:name">doublet</span> half <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Red" property="schema:name">red</span>, half <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viola_(plant)" property="schema:name">violet</span>, sown with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silver_Bells" property="schema:name">silver bells</span>, and, above all, in the perfection of his ugliness, the populace recognized him on the instant, and shouted with one voice,—</p>
<p>"'Tis <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span>! 'tis <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, the hunchback of Notre-Dame! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, the one-eyed! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, the bandy-legged! Noel! Noel!"</p>
<p>It will be seen that the poor fellow had a choice of surnames.</p>
<p>"Let the women with child beware!" shouted the scholars.</p>
<p>"Or those who wish to be," resumed Joannes.</p>
<p>The women did, in fact, hide their faces.</p>
<p>"Oh! the horrible monkey!" said one of them.</p>
<p>"As wicked as he is ugly," retorted another.</p>
<p>"He's the devil," added a third.</p>
<p>"I have the misfortune to live near Notre-Dame; I hear him prowling round the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eaves" property="schema:name">eaves</span> by night."</p>
<p>"With the cats."</p>
<p>"He's always on our roofs."</p>
<p>"He throws spells down our chimneys."</p>
<p>"The other evening, he came and made a grimace at me through my attic window. I thought that it was a man. Such a fright as I had!"</p>
<p>"I'm sure that he goes to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witches'_Sabbath" property="schema:name">witches' sabbath</span>. Once he left a broom on my leads."</p>
<p>"Oh! what a displeasing hunchback's face!"</p>
<p>"Oh! what an ill-favored <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soul" property="schema:name">soul</span>!"</p>
<p>"Whew!"</p>
<p>The men, on the contrary, were delighted and applauded. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, the object of the tumult, still stood on the threshold of the chapel, sombre and grave, and allowed them to admire him.</p>
<p>One scholar (<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Hood" property="schema:name">Robin</span> Poussepain, I think), came and laughed in his face, and too close. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> contented himself with taking him by the girdle, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hurling" property="schema:name">hurling</span> him ten paces off amid the crowd; all without uttering a word.</p>
<p>Master Coppenole, in amazement, approached him.</p>
<p>"Cross of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>! Holy Father! you possess the handsomest ugliness that I have ever beheld in my life. You would deserve to be pope at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Rome</span>, as well as at <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>."</p>
<p>So saying, he placed his hand gayly on his shoulder. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> did not stir. Coppenole went on,—</p>
<p>"You are a rogue with whom I have a fancy for carousing, were it to cost me a new dozen of twelve <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_livre" property="schema:name">livres</span> of Tours. How does it strike you?"</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> made no reply.</p>
<p>"Cross of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>!" said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span>, "are you <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>?"</p>
<p>He was, in truth, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he began to grow impatient with Coppenole's behavior, and suddenly turned towards him with so formidable a gnashing of teeth, that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flemish</span> giant recoiled, like a bull-dog before a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" property="schema:name">cat</span>.</p>
<p>Then there was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cre_recombinase" property="schema:name">cre</span>ated around that strange personage, a circle of terror and respect, whose radius was at least fifteen geometrical feet. An old woman explained to Coppenole that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>.</p>
<p>"Deaf!" said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hosiery" property="schema:name">hosier</span>, with his great <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flemish" property="schema:name">Flemish</span> laugh. "Cross of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>! He's a perfect pope!"</p>
<p>"He! I recognize him," exclaimed Jehan, who had, at last, descended from his capital, in order to see <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> at closer quarters, "he's the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> of my brother, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>. Good-day, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>!"</p>
<p>"What a devil of a man!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Hood" property="schema:name">Robin</span> Poussepain still all bruised with his fall. "He shows himself; he's a hunchback. He <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Base_on_balls" property="schema:name">walks</span>; he's bandy-legged. He looks at you; he's one-eyed. You speak to him; he's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span>. And what does this <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polyphemus" property="schema:name">Polyphemus</span> do with his tongue?"</p>
<p>"He speaks when he chooses," said the old woman; "he became <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> through ringing the bells. He is not dumb."</p>
<p>"That he lacks," remarks Jehan.</p>
<p>"And he has one eye too many," added <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Hood" property="schema:name">Robin</span> Poussepain.</p>
<p>"Not at all," said Jehan wisely. "A one-eyed man is far less complete than a blind man. He knows what he lacks."</p>
<p>In the meantime, all the beggars, all the lackeys, all the cutpurses, joined with the scholars, had gone in procession to seek, in the cupboard of the law clerks' company, the cardboard <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Papal_tiara" property="schema:name">tiara</span>, and the derisive robe of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span> of the Fools. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> allowed them to array him in them without wincing, and with a sort of proud docility. Then they made him seat himself on a motley litter. Twelve officers of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fraternities_and_sororities_in_North_America" property="schema:name">fraternity</span> of fools raised him on their shoulders; and a sort of bitter and disdainful joy lighted up the morose face of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyclops" property="schema:name">cyclops</span>, when he beheld beneath his deformed feet all those heads of handsome, straight, well-made men. Then the ragged and howling procession set out on its march, according to custom, around the inner galleries of the Courts, before making the circuit of the streets and squares.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00012">CHAPTER VI. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Esméralda_(The_Hunchback_of_Notre-Dame)" property="schema:name">ESMERALDA</span>.</h2>
<p>We are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole of this scene, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> and his piece had stood firm. His actors, spurred on by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to listen to it. He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public. This gleam of hope acquired fresh life, when he saw <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, Coppenole, and the deafening escort of the pope of the procession of fools quit the hall amid great uproar. The throng rushed eagerly after them. "Good," he said to himself, "there go all the mischief-makers." Unfortunately, all the mischief-makers constituted the entire audience. In the twinkling of an eye, the grand hall was empty.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, a few spectators still remained, some scattered, others in groups around the pillars, women, old men, or children, who had had enough of the uproar and tumult. Some scholars were still perched astride of the window-sills, engaged in gazing into the Place.</p>
<p>"Well," thought <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, "here are still as many as are required to hear the end of my mystery. They are few in number, but it is a choice audience, a lettered audience."</p>
<p>An instant later, a symphony which had been intended to produce the greatest effect on the arrival of the Virgin, was lacking. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> perceived that his music had been carried off by the procession of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span> of the Fools. "Skip it," said he, stoically.</p>
<p>He approached a group of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span>, who seemed to him to be discussing his piece. This is the fragment of conversation which he caught,—</p>
<p>"You know, Master Cheneteau, the Hôtel de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_IV_of_France" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Navarre</span>, which belonged to Monsieur de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nemours" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Nemours</span>?"</p>
<p>"Yes, opposite the Chapelle de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georges_Braque" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Braque</span>."</p>
<p>"Well, the treasury has just let it to Guillaume Alixandre, historian, for six hivres, eight <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solidus_(coin)" property="schema:name">sols</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">parisian</span>, a year."</p>
<p>"How rents are going up!"</p>
<p>"Come," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> to himself, with a sigh, "the others are listening."</p>
<p>"Comrades," suddenly shouted one of the young scamps from the window, "La Esmeralda! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">La Esmeralda</span> in the Place!"</p>
<p>This word produced a magical effect. Every one who was left in the hall flew to the windows, climbing the walls in order to see, and repeating, "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">La Esmeralda</span>! <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/La_Esmeralda_(ballet)" property="schema:name">La Esmeralda</span>?" At the same time, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Sound,_Bermuda" property="schema:name">great sound</span> of applause was heard from without.</p>
<p>"What's the meaning of this, of the Esmeralda?" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, wringing his hands in despair. "Ah, good heavens! it seems to be the turn of the windows now."</p>
<p>He returned towards the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marble" property="schema:name">marble</span> table, and saw that the representation had been interrupted. It was precisely at the instant when <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span> should have appeared with his thunder. But <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span> was standing motionless at the foot of the stage.</p>
<p>"Michel Giborne!" cried the irritated poet, "what are you doing there? Is that your part? Come up!"</p>
<p>"Alas!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span>, "a scholar has just seized the ladder."</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> looked. It was but too true. All communication between his plot and its solution was intercepted.</p>
<p>"The rascal," he <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathy_voice" property="schema:name">murmured</span>. "And why did he take that ladder?"</p>
<p>"In order to go and see the Esmeralda," replied <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span> piteously. "He said, 'Come, here's a ladder that's of no use!' and he took it."</p>
<p>This was the last blow. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> received it with resignation.</p>
<p>"May the devil fly away with you!" he said to the comedian, "and if I get my pay, you shall receive yours."</p>
<p>Then he beat a retreat, with drooping head, but the last in the field, like a general who has fought well.</p>
<p>And as he descended the winding stairs of the courts: "A fine rabble of asses and dolts these Parisians!" he muttered between his teeth; "they come to hear a mystery and don't listen to it at all! They are engrossed by every one, by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frédéric_Chopin" property="schema:name">Chopin</span> Trouillefou, by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">cardinal</span>, by Coppenole, by <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, by the devil! but by Madame the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Virgin Mary</span>, not at all. If I had known, I'd have given you <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Virgin Mary</span>; you ninnies! And I! to come to see faces and behold only backs! to be a poet, and to reap the success of an <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apothecary" property="schema:name">apothecary</span>! It is true that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Homerus</span> begged through the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Greek</span> towns, and that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nas" property="schema:name">Nas</span>o died in exile among the Muscovites. But may the devil flay me if I understand what they mean with their Esmeralda! What is that word, in the first place?—'tis <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egyptian</span>!"</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00014">CHAPTER I. FROM CHARYBDIS TO <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scylla" property="schema:name">SCYLLA</span>.</h2>
<p>Night comes on early in January. The streets were already dark when <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> issued forth from the Courts. This gloom pleased him; he was in haste to reach some obscure and deserted <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alley" property="schema:name">alley</span>, in order there to meditate at his ease, and in order that the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span> might place the first dressing upon the wound of the poet. Philosophy, moreover, was his sole refuge, for he did not know where he was to lodge for the night. After the brilliant failure of his first theatrical venture, he dared not return to the lodging which he occupied in the Rue Grenier-sur-l'Eau, opposite to the Port-au-Foin, having depended upon receiving from monsieur the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Provost_(civil)" property="schema:name">provost</span> for his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epithalamium" property="schema:name">epithalamium</span>, the wherewithal to pay Master Guillaume Doulx-Sire, farmer of the taxes on cloven-footed animals in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, the rent which he owed him, that is to say, twelve <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_sol" property="schema:name">sols</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">parisian</span>; twelve times the value of all that he possessed in the world, including his trunk-hose, his shirt, and his cap. After reflecting a moment, temporarily sheltered beneath the little wicket of the prison of the treasurer of the Sainte-Chappelle, as to the shelter which he would select for the night, having all the pavements of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> to choose from, he remembered to have noticed the week previously in the Rue de la Savaterie, at the door of a councillor of the parliament, a stepping stone for mounting a mule, and to have said to himself that that stone would furnish, on occasion, a very excellent pillow for a mendicant or a poet. He thanked <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_providence" property="schema:name">Providence</span> for having sent this happy idea to him; but, as he was preparing to cross the Place, in order to reach the tortuous <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labyrinth" property="schema:name">labyrinth</span> of the city, where <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Meander" property="schema:name">meander</span> all those old sister streets, the Rues de la Barillerie, de la Vielle-Draperie, de la Savaterie, de la Juiverie, etc., still extant to-day, with their nine-story houses, he saw the procession of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span> of the Fools, which was also emerging from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court" property="schema:name">court house</span>, and rushing across the courtyard, with great cries, a great flashing of torches, and the music which belonged to him, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>. This sight revived the pain of his self-love; he fled. In the bitterness of his dramatic misadventure, everything which reminded him of the festival of that day irritated his wound and made it bleed.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>He was on the point of turning to the Pont Saint-Michel; children were running about here and there with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire_lance" property="schema:name">fire lances</span> and rockets.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pest,_Hungary" property="schema:name">Pest</span> on firework candles!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>; and he fell back on the Pont au Change. To the house at the head of the bridge there had been affixed three small banners, representing the king, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dauphin_of_France" property="schema:name">dauphin</span>, and Marguerite of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flanders" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Flanders</span>, and six little <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennon" property="schema:name">pennons</span> on which were portrayed the Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austria" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Austria</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" property="schema:name">Cardinal</span> de <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Bourbon" property="schema:name">Bourbon</span>, M. de Beaujeu, and Madame <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joan_of_France,_Duchess_of_Berry" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Jeanne de France</span>, and Monsieur the Bastard of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Bourbon" property="schema:name">Bourbon</span>, and I know not whom else; all being illuminated with torches. The rabble were admiring.</p>
<p>"Happy painter, Jehan Fourbault!" said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> with a deep sigh; and he turned his back upon the bannerets and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennon" property="schema:name">pennons</span>. A street opened before him; he thought it so dark and deserted that he hoped to there escape from all the rumors as well as from all the gleams of the festival. At the end of a few moments his foot came in contact with an obstacle; he stumbled and fell. It was the May <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Truss" property="schema:name">truss</span>, which the clerks of the clerks' law court had deposited that morning at the door of a president of the parliament, in honor of the solemnity of the day. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> bore this new disaster heroically; he picked himself up, and reached the water's edge. After leaving behind him the civic Tournelle* and the criminal tower, and skirted the great walls of the king's garden, on that unpaved strand where the mud reached to his ankles, he reached the western point of the city, and considered for some time the islet of the Passeur-aux-Vaches, which has disappeared beneath the bronze horse of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pont_Neuf" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Pont Neuf</span>. The islet appeared to him in the shadow like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shadow_people" property="schema:name">black mass</span>, beyond the narrow strip of whitish water which separated him from it. One could divine by the ray of a tiny light the sort of hut in the form of a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beehive" property="schema:name">beehive</span> where the ferryman of cows took refuge at night.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  A chamber of the ancient parliament of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>.<br/></div>
<p>"Happy ferryman!" thought <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>; "you do not dream of glory, and you do not make marriage songs! What matters it to you, if kings and Duchesses of Burgundy marry? You know no other daisies (<i>marguerites</i>) than those which your April greensward gives your cows to browse upon; while I, a poet, am hooted, and shiver, and owe twelve sous, and the soles of my shoes are so transparent, that they might serve as glasses for your lantern! Thanks, ferryman, your cabin rests my eyes, and makes me forget Paris!"</p>
<p>He was roused from his almost lyric ecstacy, by a big double <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Saint-Jean</span> cracker, which suddenly went off from the happy cabin. It was the cow ferryman, who was taking his part in the rejoicings of the day, and letting off <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fireworks" property="schema:name">fireworks</span>.</p>
<p>This cracker made <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>'s skin bristle up all over.</p>
<p>"Accursed festival!" he exclaimed, "wilt thou pursue me everywhere? Oh! good <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>! even to the ferryman's!"</p>
<p>Then he looked at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span> at his feet, and a horrible temptation took possession of him:</p>
<p>"Oh!" said he, "I would gladly drown myself, were the water not so cold!"</p>
<p>Then a desperate resolution occurred to him. It was, since he could not escape from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span> of the Fools, from Jehan Fourbault's bannerets, from May <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Truss" property="schema:name">trusses</span>, from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Squib_(explosive)" property="schema:name">squibs</span> and crackers, to go to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Place_de_l'Hôtel-de-Ville" property="schema:name">Place de Grève</span>.</p>
<p>"At least," he said to himself, "I shall there have a firebrand of joy wherewith to warm myself, and I can sup on some crumbs of the three great armorial bearings of royal <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sugar" property="schema:name">sugar</span> which have been erected on the public refreshment-stall of the city."</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00015">CHAPTER II. THE PLACE <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">DE</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Place_de_l'Hôtel-de-Ville" property="schema:name">GREVE</span>.</h2>
<p>There remains to-day but a very imperceptible vestige of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Place_de_l'Hôtel-de-Ville" property="schema:name">Place de Grève</span>, such as it existed then; it consists in the charming little turret, which occupies the angle north of the Place, and which, already enshrouded in the ignoble plaster which fills with paste the delicate lines of its sculpture, would soon have disappeared, perhaps submerged by that flood of new houses which so rapidly devours all the ancient façades of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>.</p>
<p>The persons who, like ourselves, never cross the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Place_de_l'Hôtel-de-Ville" property="schema:name">Place de Grève</span> without casting a glance of pity and sympathy on that poor turret strangled between two hovels of the time of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rococo" property="schema:name">Louis XV</span>., can easily reconstruct in their minds the aggregate of edifices to which it belonged, and find again entire in it the ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> place of the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>It was then, as it is to-day, an irregular <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trapezoid" property="schema:name">trapezoid</span>, bordered on one side by the quay, and on the other three by a series of lofty, narrow, and gloomy houses. By day, one could admire the variety of its edifices, all sculptured in stone or wood, and already presenting complete specimens of the different domestic architectures of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages" property="schema:name">Middle Ages</span>, running back from the fifteenth to the eleventh century, from the casement which had begun to dethrone the arch, to the Roman semicircle, which had been supplanted by the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ogive" property="schema:name">ogive</span>, and which still occupies, below it, the first story of that ancient house de la Tour Roland, at the corner of the Place upon the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>, on the side of the street with the Tannerie. At night, one could distinguish nothing of all that mass of buildings, except the black indentation of the roofs, unrolling their chain of acute angles round the place; for one of the radical differences between the cities of that time, and the cities of the present day, lay in the façades which looked upon the places and streets, and which were then <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gable" property="schema:name">gables</span>. For the last two centuries the houses have been turned round.</p>
<p>In the centre of the eastern side of the Place, rose a heavy and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hybrid_(biology)" property="schema:name">hybrid</span> construction, formed of three buildings placed in juxtaposition. It was called by three names which explain its history, its destination, and its architecture: "The House of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dauphin_of_France" property="schema:name">Dauphin</span>," because <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Charles V</span>., when <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dauphin_of_France" property="schema:name">Dauphin</span>, had inhabited it; "The Marchandise," because it had served as town hall; and "The Pillared House" (<i>domus ad piloria</i>), because of a series of large pillars which sustained the three stories. The city found there all that is required for a city like <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>; a chapel in which to pray to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>; a <i>plaidoyer</i>, or pleading room, in which to hold hearings, and to repel, at need, the King's people; and under the roof, an <i>arsenac</i> full of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artillery" property="schema:name">artillery</span>. For the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bourgeoisie" property="schema:name">bourgeois</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span> were aware that it is not sufficient to pray in every conjuncture, and to plead for the franchises of the city, and they had always in reserve, in the garret of the town hall, a few good rusty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arquebus" property="schema:name">arquebuses</span>. The Grève had then that sinister aspect which it preserves to-day from the execrable ideas which it awakens, and from the sombre town hall of Dominique Bocador, which has replaced the Pillared House. It must be admitted that a permanent <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span> and a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pillory" property="schema:name">pillory</span>, "a justice and a ladder," as they were called in that day, erected side by side in the centre of the pavement, contributed not a little to cause eyes to be turned away from that fatal place, where so many beings full of life and health have agonized; where, fifty years later, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fever" property="schema:name">fever</span> of Saint Vallier was destined to have its birth, that terror of the scaffold, the most monstrous of all maladies because it comes not from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" property="schema:name">God</span>, but from man.</p>
<p>It is a consoling idea (let us remark in passing), to think that the death penalty, which three hundred years ago still encumbered with its iron wheels, its stone <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbets</span>, and all its paraphernalia of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Torture" property="schema:name">torture</span>, permanent and riveted to the pavement, the Grève, the Halles, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Île_de_la_Cité" property="schema:name">Place Dauphine</span>, the Cross du Trahoir, the Marché aux Pourceaux, that hideous Montfauçon, the barrier des Sergents, the Place aux Chats, the Porte Saint-Denis, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine-et-Marne" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Champeaux</span>, the Porte Baudets, the Porte Saint Jacques, without reckoning the innumerable ladders of the provosts, the bishop of the chapters, of the abbots, of the priors, who had the decree of life and death,—without reckoning the judicial drownings in the river <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Seine</span>; it is consoling to-day, after having lost successively all the pieces of its armor, its luxury of torment, its penalty of imagination and fancy, its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Torture" property="schema:name">torture</span> for which it reconstructed every five years a leather bed at the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Châtelet" property="schema:name">Grand Châtelet</span>, that ancient <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suzerainty" property="schema:name">suzerain</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feudalism" property="schema:name">feudal society</span> almost expunged from our laws and our cities, hunted from code to code, chased from place to place, has no longer, in our immense <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, any more than a dishonored corner of the Grève,—than a miserable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guillotine" property="schema:name">guillotine</span>, furtive, uneasy, shameful, which seems always afraid of being caught in the act, so quickly does it disappear after having dealt its blow.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00016">CHAPTER III. KISSES FOR BLOWS.</h2>
<p>When <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Pierre Gringoire</span> arrived on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Place_de_l'Hôtel-de-Ville" property="schema:name">Place de Grève</span>, he was paralyzed. He had directed his course across the Pont aux Meuniers, in order to avoid the rabble on the Pont au Change, and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennon" property="schema:name">pennons</span> of Jehan Fourbault; but the wheels of all the bishop's mills had splashed him as he passed, and his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doublet_(clothing)" property="schema:name">doublet</span> was drenched; it seemed to him besides, that the failure of his piece had rendered him still more sensible to cold than usual. Hence he made haste to draw near the bonfire, which was burning magnificently in the middle of the Place. But a considerable crowd formed a circle around it.</p>
<p>"Accursed Parisians!" he said to himself (for <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, like a true dramatic poet, was subject to monologues) "there they are obstructing my fire! Nevertheless, I am greatly in need of a chimney corner; my shoes drink in the water, and all those cursed mills wept upon me! That devil of a Bishop of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>, with his mills! I'd just like to know what use a bishop can make of a mill! Does he expect to become a miller instead of a bishop? If only my malediction is needed for that, I bestow it upon him! and his cathedral, and his mills! Just see if those boobies will put themselves out! Move aside! I'd like to know what they are doing there! They are warming themselves, much pleasure may it give them! They are watching a hundred fagots burn; a fine spectacle!"</p>
<p>On looking more closely, he perceived that the circle was much larger than was required simply for the purpose of getting warm at the king's fire, and that this concourse of people had not been attracted solely by the beauty of the hundred fagots which were burning.</p>
<p>In a vast space left free between the crowd and the fire, a young girl was dancing.</p>
<p>Whether this young girl was a human being, a fairy, or an angel, is what <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, sceptical <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosopher</span> and ironical poet that he was, could not decide at the first moment, so fascinated was he by this dazzling vision.</p>
<p>She was not tall, though she seemed so, so boldly did her slender form dart about. She was swarthy of complexion, but one divined that, by day, her skin must possess that beautiful golden tone of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andalusia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Andalusians</span> and the Roman women. Her little foot, too, was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andalusia" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Andalusian</span>, for it was both pinched and at ease in its graceful shoe. She danced, she turned, she whirled rapidly about on an old <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_carpet" property="schema:name">Persian rug</span>, spread negligently under her feet; and each time that her radiant face passed before you, as she whirled, her great black eyes darted a flash of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lightning" property="schema:name">lightning</span> at you.</p>
<p>All around her, all glances were riveted, all mouths open; and, in fact, when she danced thus, to the humming of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basque_language" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Basque</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span>, which her two pure, rounded arms raised above her head, slender, frail and vivacious as a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wasp" property="schema:name">wasp</span>, with her corsage of gold without a fold, her variegated gown puffing out, her bare shoulders, her delicate limbs, which her petticoat revealed at times, her black hair, her eyes of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire" property="schema:name">flame</span>, she was a supernatural creature.</p>
<p>"In truth," said Gringoire to himself, "she is a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salamander" property="schema:name">salamander</span>, she is a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nymph" property="schema:name">nymph</span>, she is a goddess, she is a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maenad" property="schema:name">bacchante</span> of the Menelean Mount!"</p>
<p>At that moment, one of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salamander" property="schema:name">salamander</span>'s braids of hair became unfastened, and a piece of yellow <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Copper" property="schema:name">copper</span> which was attached to it, rolled to the ground.</p>
<p>"Hé, no!" said he, "she is a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>!"</p>
<p>All illusions had disappeared.</p>
<p>She began her dance once more; she took from the ground two swords, whose points she rested against her brow, and which she made to turn in one direction, while she turned in the other; it was a purely <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> effect. But, disenchanted though Gringoire was, the whole effect of this picture was not without its charm and its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_(paranormal)" property="schema:name">magic</span>; the bonfire illuminated, with a red flaring light, which trembled, all alive, over the circle of faces in the crowd, on the brow of the young girl, and at the background of the Place cast a pallid reflection, on one side upon the ancient, black, and wrinkled façade of the House of Pillars, on the other, upon the old stone <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibbeting" property="schema:name">gibbet</span>.</p>
<p>Among the thousands of visages which that light tinged with scarlet, there was one which seemed, even more than all the others, absorbed in contemplation of the dancer. It was the face of a man, austere, calm, and sombre. This man, whose costume was concealed by the crowd which surrounded him, did not appear to be more than five and thirty years of age; nevertheless, he was bald; he had merely a few tufts of thin, gray hair on his temples; his broad, high forehead had begun to be furrowed with wrinkles, but his deep-set eyes sparkled with extraordinary youthfulness, an ardent life, a profound passion. He kept them fixed incessantly on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, and, while the giddy young girl of sixteen danced and whirled, for the pleasure of all, his revery seemed to become more and more sombre. From time to time, a smile and a sigh met upon his lips, but the smile was more melancholy than the sigh.</p>
<p>The young girl, stopped at length, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathless_(1960_film)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">breathless</span>, and the people applauded her lovingly.</p>
<p>"Djali!" said the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>.</p>
<p>Then <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> saw come up to her, a pretty little white <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>, alert, wide-awake, glossy, with gilded horns, gilded hoofs, and gilded collar, which he had not hitherto perceived, and which had remained lying curled up on one corner of the carpet watching his mistress dance.</p>
<p>"Djali!" said the dancer, "it is your turn."</p>
<p>And, seating herself, she gracefully presented her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span> to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>.</p>
<p>"Djali," she continued, "what month is this?"</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> lifted its fore foot, and struck one blow upon the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span>. It was the first month in the year, in fact.</p>
<p>"Djali," pursued the young girl, turning her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span> round, "what day of the month is this?"</p>
<p>Djali raised his little gilt <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claw" property="schema:name">hoof</span>, and struck six blows on the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span>.</p>
<p>"Djali," pursued the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egyptian</span>, with still another movement of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span>, "what hour of the day is it?"</p>
<p>Djali struck seven blows. At that moment, the clock of the Pillar House rang out seven.</p>
<p>The people were amazed.</p>
<p>"There's <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Witchcraft" property="schema:name">sorcery</span> at the bottom of it," said a sinister voice in the crowd. It was that of the bald man, who never removed his eyes from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>.</p>
<p>She shuddered and turned round; but applause broke forth and drowned the morose exclamation.</p>
<p>It even effaced it so completely from her mind, that she continued to question her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>.</p>
<p>"Djali, what does Master Guichard Grand-Remy, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> of the pistoliers of the town do, at the procession of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Presentation_of_Jesus_at_the_Temple" property="schema:name">Candlemas</span>?"</p>
<p>Djali reared himself on his hind legs, and began to bleat, marching along with so much dainty <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gravitation" property="schema:name">gravity</span>, that the entire circle of spectators burst into a laugh at this parody of the interested devoutness of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_captain" property="schema:name">captain</span> of pistoliers.</p>
<p>"Djali," resumed the young girl, emboldened by her growing success, "how preaches Master Jacques Charmolue, procurator to the king in the ecclesiastical court?"</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span> seated himself on his hind quarters, and began to bleat, waving his fore feet in so strange a manner, that, with the exception of the bad <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">French</span>, and worse <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin" typeof="schema:Language" property="schema:name">Latin</span>, Jacques Charmolue was there complete,—gesture, accent, and attitude.</p>
<p>And the crowd applauded louder than ever.</p>
<p>"<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sacrilege" property="schema:name">Sacrilege</span>! profanation!" resumed the voice of the bald man.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> turned round once more.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said she, "'tis that villanous man!" Then, thrusting her under <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lip" property="schema:name">lip</span> out beyond the upper, she made a little pout, which appeared to be familiar to her, executed a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glossary_of_ballet" property="schema:name">pirouette</span> on her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heel_(professional_wrestling)" property="schema:name">heel</span>, and set about collecting in her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span> the gifts of the multitude.</p>
<p>Big blanks, little blanks, targes* and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eagle" property="schema:name">eagle</span> liards showered into it.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  A blank: an old French coin; six blanks were worth two sous<br/>and a half; targe, an ancient coin of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burgundy" typeof="schema:AdministrativeArea" property="schema:name">Burgundy</span>, a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Farthing_(British_coin)" property="schema:name">farthing</span>.<br/></div>
<p>All at once, she passed in front of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> put his hand so recklessly into his pocket that she halted. "The devil!" said the poet, finding at the bottom of his pocket the reality, that is, to say, a void. In the meantime, the pretty girl stood there, gazing at him with her big eyes, and holding out her <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourine</span> to him and waiting. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> broke into a violent <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perspiration" property="schema:name">perspiration</span>.</p>
<p>If he had all <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peru" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Peru</span> in his pocket, he would certainly have given it to the dancer; but <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> had not <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peru" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Peru</span>, and, moreover, America had not yet been discovered.</p>
<p>Happily, an unexpected incident came to his rescue.</p>
<p>"Will you take yourself off, you <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egyptian</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grasshopper" property="schema:name">grasshopper</span>?" cried a sharp voice, which proceeded from the darkest corner of the Place.</p>
<p>The young girl turned round in affright. It was no longer the voice of the bald man; it was the voice of a woman, bigoted and malicious.</p>
<p>However, this cry, which alarmed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>, delighted a troop of children who were prowling about there.</p>
<p>"It is the recluse of the Tour-Roland," they exclaimed, with wild laughter, "it is the sacked <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nun" property="schema:name">nun</span> who is scolding! Hasn't she supped? Let's carry her the remains of the city refreshments!"</p>
<p>All rushed towards the Pillar House.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> had taken advantage of the dancer's embarrassment, to disappear. The children's shouts had reminded him that he, also, had not supped, so he ran to the public buffet. But the little rascals had better legs than he; when he arrived, they had stripped the table. There remained not so much as a miserable <i>camichon</i> at five sous the pound. Nothing remained upon the wall but slender <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fleur-de-lis" property="schema:name">fleurs-de-lis</span>, mingled with rose bushes, painted in 1434 by Mathieu Biterne. It was a meagre supper.</p>
<p>It is an unpleasant thing to go to bed without supper, it is a still less pleasant thing not to sup and not to know where one is to sleep. That was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>'s condition. No supper, no shelter; he saw himself pressed on all sides by necessity, and he found necessity very crabbed. He had long ago discovered the truth, that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jupiter_(mythology)" property="schema:name">Jupiter</span> created men during a fit of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Misanthropy" property="schema:name">misanthropy</span>, and that during a wise man's whole life, his destiny holds his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosophy</span> in a state of siege. As for himself, he had never seen the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blockade" property="schema:name">blockade</span> so complete; he heard his stomach sounding a parley, and he considered it very much out of place that evil destiny should capture his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philosophy" property="schema:name">philosophy</span> by famine.</p>
<p>This melancholy revery was absorbing him more and more, when a song, quaint but full of sweetness, suddenly tore him from it. It was the young <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> who was singing.</p>
<p>Her voice was like her dancing, like her beauty. It was indefinable and charming; something pure and sonorous, aerial, winged, so to speak. There were continual outbursts, melodies, unexpected cadences, then simple phrases strewn with aerial and hissing notes; then floods of scales which would have put a nightingale to rout, but in which harmony was always present; then soft modulations of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Octave" property="schema:name">octaves</span> which rose and fell, like the bosom of the young singer. Her beautiful face followed, with singular mobility, all the caprices of her song, from the wildest inspiration to the chastest dignity. One would have pronounced her now a mad creature, now a queen.</p>
<p>The words which she sang were in a tongue unknown to Gringoire, and which seemed to him to be unknown to herself, so little relation did the expression which she imparted to her song <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bear" property="schema:name">bear</span> to the sense of the words. Thus, these four lines, in her mouth, were madly <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homosexuality" property="schema:name">gay</span>,—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">  <i>Un cofre de gran riqueza<br/>    Hallaron dentro un pilar,<br/>  Dentro del, nuevas banderas<br/>   Con figuras de espantar</i>.*<br/></div>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">     *  A coffer of great richness<br/>    In a pillar's heart they found,<br/>   Within it lay new banners,<br/>    With figures to astound.<br/></div>
<p>And an instant afterwards, at the accents which she imparted to this stanza,—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">  <i>Alarabes de cavallo<br/>   Sin poderse menear,<br/>  Con espadas, y los cuellos,<br/>   Ballestas de buen echar</i>,<br/></div>
<p>Gringoire felt the tears start to his eyes. Nevertheless, her song breathed joy, most of all, and she seemed to sing like a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bird" property="schema:name">bird</span>, from <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serenity_(Firefly_episode)" typeof="schema:CreativeWork" property="schema:name">serenity</span> and heedlessness.</p>
<p>The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s song had disturbed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>'s revery as the swan disturbs the water. He listened in a sort of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rapture" property="schema:name">rapture</span>, and forgetfulness of everything. It was the first moment in the course of many hours when he did not feel that he suffered.</p>
<p>The moment was brief.</p>
<p>The same woman's voice, which had interrupted the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s dance, interrupted her song.</p>
<p>"Will you hold your tongue, you <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cricket" property="schema:name">cricket</span> of hell?" it cried, still from the same obscure corner of the place.</p>
<p>The poor "<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cricket" property="schema:name">cricket</span>" stopped short. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span> covered up his ears.</p>
<p>"Oh!" he exclaimed, "accursed saw with missing teeth, which comes to break the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lyre" property="schema:name">lyre</span>!"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the other spectators <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathy_voice" property="schema:name">murmured</span> like himself; "To the devil with the sacked <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nun" property="schema:name">nun</span>!" said some of them. And the old invisible kill-joy might have had occasion to repent of her aggressions against the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span> had their attention not been diverted at this moment by the procession of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span> of the Fools, which, after having traversed many streets and squares, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Debouch" property="schema:name">debouched</span> on the Place de Grève, with all its torches and all its uproar.</p>
<p>This procession, which our readers have seen set out from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law_Courts_of_Brussels" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Palais de Justice</span>, had organized on the way, and had been recruited by all the knaves, idle thieves, and unemployed <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span> in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Paris</span>; so that it presented a very respectable aspect when it arrived at the Grève.</p>
<p>First came Egypt. The Duke of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egypt</span> headed it, on horseback, with his counts on foot holding his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bridle" property="schema:name">bridle</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stirrup" property="schema:name">stirrups</span> for him; behind them, the male and female <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt" property="schema:name">Egyptians</span>, pell-mell, with their little children crying on their shoulders; all—duke, counts, and populace—in rags and tatters. Then came the Kingdom of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argot" property="schema:name">Argot</span>; that is to say, all the thieves of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">France</span>, arranged according to the order of their dignity; the minor people walking first. Thus defiled by fours, with the divers insignia of their grades, in that strange faculty, most of them lame, some cripples, others one-armed, shop clerks, pilgrim, <i>hubins</i>, bootblacks, thimble-riggers, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Street_child" property="schema:name">street arabs</span>, beggars, the blear-eyed beggars, thieves, the weakly, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagrancy_(people)" property="schema:name">vagabonds</span>, merchants, sham soldiers, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gold" property="schema:name">goldsmiths</span>, passed masters of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pickpocketing" property="schema:name">pickpockets</span>, isolated thieves. A catalogue that would weary <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Homer</span>. In the centre of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Papal_conclave" property="schema:name">conclave</span> of the passed masters of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pickpocketing" property="schema:name">pickpockets</span>, one had some difficulty in distinguishing the King of Argot, the grand coësre, so called, crouching in a little cart drawn by two big dogs. After the kingdom of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Argot" property="schema:name">Argot</span>iers, came the Empire of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galilee" property="schema:name">Galilee</span>. Guillaume <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Rousseau</span>, Emperor of the Empire of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galilee" property="schema:name">Galilee</span>, marched majestically in his robe of purple, spotted with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wine" property="schema:name">wine</span>, preceded by buffoons wrestling and executing military dances; surrounded by his macebearers, his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pickpocketing" property="schema:name">pickpockets</span> and clerks of the chamber of accounts. Last of all came the corporation of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law_clerk" property="schema:name">law clerks</span>, with its <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maypole" property="schema:name">maypoles</span> crowned with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flower" property="schema:name">flowers</span>, its black robes, its music worthy of the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orgy" property="schema:name">orgy</span>, and its large candles of yellow <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wax" property="schema:name">wax</span>. In the centre of this crowd, the grand officers of the Brotherhood of Fools bore on their shoulders a litter more loaded down with candles than the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reliquary" property="schema:name">reliquary</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Panthéon,_Paris" property="schema:name">Sainte-Geneviève</span> in time of pest; and on this litter shone resplendent, with <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crosier" property="schema:name">crosier</span>, cope, and mitre, the new <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span> of the Fools, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Change_ringing" property="schema:name">bellringer</span> of Notre-Dame, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> the hunchback.</p>
<p>Each section of this grotesque procession had its own music. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt" typeof="schema:Country" property="schema:name">Egyptians</span> made their drums and African <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tambourine" property="schema:name">tambourines</span> resound. The slang men, not a very musical race, still clung to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goat" property="schema:name">goat</span>'s horn <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trumpet" property="schema:name">trumpet</span> and the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gothic_architecture" property="schema:name">Gothic</span> rubebbe of the twelfth century. The Empire of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galilee" property="schema:name">Galilee</span> was not much more advanced; among its music one could hardly distinguish some miserable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rebec" property="schema:name">rebec</span>, from the infancy of the art, still imprisoned in the <i>re-la-mi</i>. But it was around the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span> of the Fools that all the musical riches of the epoch were displayed in a magnificent discord. It was nothing but <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soprano" property="schema:name">soprano</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rebec" property="schema:name">rebecs</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Countertenor" property="schema:name">counter-tenor</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rebec" property="schema:name">rebecs</span>, and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Types_of_trombone" property="schema:name">tenor</span> <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rebec" property="schema:name">rebecs</span>, not to reckon the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flute" property="schema:name">flutes</span> and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brass_instrument" property="schema:name">brass instruments</span>. Alas! our readers will remember that this was <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>'s <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orchestra" property="schema:name">orchestra</span>.</p>
<p>It is difficult to convey an idea of the degree of proud and blissful expansion to which the sad and hideous visage of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had attained during the transit from the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law_Courts_of_Brussels" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Palais de Justice</span>, to the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Place_de_l'Hôtel-de-Ville" property="schema:name">Place de Grève</span>. It was the first enjoyment of self-love that he had ever experienced. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/County_Down" typeof="schema:Place" property="schema:name">Down</span> to that day, he had known only humiliation, disdain for his condition, disgust for his person. Hence, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> though he was, he enjoyed, like a veritable pope, the acclamations of that throng, which he hated because he felt that he was hated by it. What mattered it that his people consisted of a pack of fools, cripples, thieves, and beggars? it was still a people and he was its sovereign. And he accepted seriously all this ironical applause, all this derisive respect, with which the crowd mingled, it must be admitted, a good deal of very real fear. For the hunchback was robust; for the bandy-legged fellow was agile; for the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> man was malicious: three qualities which temper ridicule.</p>
<p>We are far from believing, however, that the new <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope" property="schema:name">Pope</span> of the Fools understood both the sentiments which he felt and the sentiments which he inspired. The spirit which was lodged in this failure of a body had, necessarily, something incomplete and <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deafness" property="schema:name">deaf</span> about it. Thus, what he felt at the moment was to him, absolutely vague, indistinct, and confused. Only joy made itself felt, only pride dominated. Around that sombre and unhappy face, there hung a <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radiance" property="schema:name">radiance</span>.</p>
<p>It was, then, not without surprise and alarm, that at the very moment when <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> was passing the Pillar House, in that semi-intoxicated state, a man was seen to dart from the crowd, and to tear from his hands, with a gesture of anger, his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crosier" property="schema:name">crosier</span> of gilded wood, the emblem of his mock popeship.</p>
<p>This man, this rash individual, was the man with the bald brow, who, a moment earlier, standing with the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">gypsy</span>'s group had chilled the poor girl with his words of menace and of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hectare" property="schema:name">ha</span>tred. He was dressed in an ecclesiastical costume. At the moment when he stood forth from the crowd, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>, who had not noticed him up to that time, recognized him: "Hold!" he said, with an exclamation of astonishment. "Eh! 'tis my master in <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermes" property="schema:name">Hermes</span>, Dom <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Frollo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Claude Frollo</span>, the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>! What the devil does he want of that old one-eyed fellow? He'll get himself devoured!"</p>
<p>A cry of terror arose, in fact. The formidable <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> had hurled himself from the litter, and the women turned aside their eyes in order not to see him tear the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span> asunder.</p>
<p>He made one bound as far as the priest, looked at him, and fell upon his knees.</p>
<p>The priest tore off his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiara" property="schema:name">tiara</span>, broke his crozier, and rent his tinsel cope.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> remained on his knees, with head bent and hands clasped. Then there was established between them a strange dialogue of signs and gestures, for neither of them spoke. The priest, erect on his feet, irritated, threatening, imperious; <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, prostrate, humble, suppliant. And, nevertheless, it is certain that <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> could have crushed the priest with his thumb.</p>
<p>At length the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, giving <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>'s powerful shoulder a rough shake, made him a sign to rise and follow him.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> rose.</p>
<p>Then the Brotherhood of Fools, their first stupor having passed off, wished to defend their pope, so abruptly dethroned. The <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romani_people" property="schema:name">Egyptians</span>, the men of slang, and all the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monasticism" property="schema:name">fraternity</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law_clerk" property="schema:name">law clerks</span>, gathered howling round the priest.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> placed himself in front of the priest, set in play the muscles of his athletic fists, and glared upon the assailants with the snarl of an angry <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiger" property="schema:name">tiger</span>.</p>
<p>The priest resumed his sombre <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gravitation" property="schema:name">gravity</span>, made a sign to <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span>, and retired in silence.</p>
<p><span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> walked in front of him, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scattering" property="schema:name">scattering</span> the crowd as he passed.</p>
<p>When they had traversed the populace and the Place, the cloud of curious and idle were minded to follow them. <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> then constituted himself the rearguard, and followed the <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archdeacon" property="schema:name">archdeacon</span>, walking backwards, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Squat_(exercise)" property="schema:name">squat</span>, surly, monstrous, bristling, gathering up his limbs, licking his <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wild_boar" property="schema:name">boar</span>'s <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tusk" property="schema:name">tusks</span>, <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death_growl" property="schema:name">growling</span> like a wild beast, and imparting to the crowd immense vibrations, with a look or a gesture.</p>
<p>Both were allowed to plunge into a dark and narrow street, where no one dared to venture after them; so thoroughly did the mere <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chimera_(mythology)" property="schema:name">chimera</span> of <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quasimodo" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name">Quasimodo</span> gnashing his teeth bar the entrance.</p>
<p>"Here's a marvellous thing," said <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Gringoire" property="schema:name">Gringoire</span>; "but where the deuce shall I find some supper?"</p>
