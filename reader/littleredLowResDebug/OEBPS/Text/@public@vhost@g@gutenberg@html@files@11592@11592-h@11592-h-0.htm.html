  <p>There was once a sweet little maid who lived with her father and mother in a pretty little cottage at the edge of the village. At the further end of the wood was another pretty cottage and in it lived her grandmother.</p>

Once she gave her a red cloak with a hood which she always wore, so people called her Little Red Riding Hood.</p>

  <p>One morning Little Red Riding Hood's mother said, "Put on your things and go to see your grandmother. She has been ill; take along this basket for her. I have put in it eggs, butter and cake, and other dainties."</p>

  <p >Little Red Riding Hood wandered from her path and was stooping to pick a flower when from behind her a gruff voice said, "Good morning, Little Red Riding Hood." Little Red Riding Hood turned around and saw a great big wolf, but Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked beast the wolf was, so she was not afraid.</p>
  <p>"What have you in that basket, Little Red Riding Hood?"</p>

  <p>"Eggs and butter and cake, Mr. Wolf."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going with them, Little Red Riding Hood?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to my grandmother, who is ill, Mr. Wolf."</p>

  <p>"Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?"</p>

  <p>"Along that path, past the wild rose bushes, then through the gate at the end of the wood, Mr. Wolf."</p>

  </div>

  <p>Then Mr. Wolf again said "Good morning" and set off, and Little Red Riding Hood again went in search of wild flowers.</p>

  <p>At last he reached the porch covered with flowers and knocked at the door of the cottage.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" called the grandmother.</p>

  <p>"Little Red Riding Hood," said the wicked wolf.</p>

  <p>"Press the latch, open the door, and walk in," said the grandmother.</p>

  <p about="http://www.example.com/books/wikinomics" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:onyx="http://www.gsi.dit.upm.es/ontologies/onyx/ns#">The wolf pressed the latch, and walked in where the grandmother lay in bed. He made one jump at her, but she <b><span id="par5" property="onyx:hasEmotion">jump</span>ed</b> out of bed into a closet. Then the wolf put on the cap which she had dropped and crept under the bedclothes.</p>

  <p>In a short while Little Red Riding Hood knocked at the door, and walked in, saying, "Good morning, Grandmother, I have brought you eggs, butter and cake, and here is a bunch of flowers I gathered in the wood." As she came nearer the bed she said, "What big ears you have, Grandmother."</p>

  <p>"All the better to hear you with, my dear."</p>

  <p>"What big eyes you have, Grandmother."</p>

  <p>"All the better to see you with, my dear."</p>

  <p>"But, Grandmother, what a big nose you have."</p>

  <p>"All the better to smell with, my dear."</p>

  <p>"But, Grandmother, what a big mouth you have."</p>

  <p>"All the better to eat you up with, my dear," he said as he sprang at Little Red Riding Hood.</p>

  <p>Just at that moment Little Red Riding Hood's father was passing the cottage and heard her scream. He rushed in and with his axe chopped off Mr. Wolf's head.</p>

Then Little Red Riding Hood's father carried her home and they lived happily ever after.</p>
